00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,181
A little bit

170
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:14,989
A little bit

171
00:11:15,013 --> 00:11:18,986


172
00:11:19,084 --> 00:11:21,196


173
00:11:21,229 --> 00:11:22,577
my sister

174
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:25,399
i love you
- Dad.. Dad

175
00:11:25,424 --> 00:11:28,441
my sister..

176
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:32,944
Baba ji what happened to my man?
- This is not your man.. Ghosh Babu

177
00:11:32,969 --> 00:11:34,044
What Ghosh Babu?

178
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,283


179
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:39,421
Two years ago, he became paralyzed and died after drinking alcohol

180
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,385
Since then, his soul has been inside him

181
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,704
Dad.. Dad
- Bang.. Good, good, because how well you do is the top

182
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:48,955
Oh father father.. that means father

183
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,767
Dad.. Dad
- Oh father.. good

184
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,286
Baba ji save me

185
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:58,443
I will save you, you will save me.. But Ghosh Babu's soul was very much addicted to lust

186
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,968
So whenever his soul enters your husband..

187
00:12:00,992 --> 00:12:04,107
They will try to catch your brother who is working for you

188
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:07,755


189
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,805


190
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:14,071
my sister..
- Look for it

191
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,964
Narayana.. Rama Krishna Rama

192
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:26,543
What sin did I commit?
- Don't think.. Don't think

193
00:12:26,568 --> 00:12:31,413
Hey little one.. It's good, isn't your father?
- Good, good, good

194
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,035
Do you know what is the worst case of demons?

195
00:12:34,148 --> 00:12:37,236
Leave a common man.. a king will not leave even a Maharaj

196
00:12:38,574 --> 00:12:43,107
Wow.. Great splendor, great light, great appearance, great wealth

197
00:12:43,132 --> 00:12:46,134
When you see the face, you can know that the king is the king

198
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:49,959
Not a king now

199
00:12:50,873 --> 00:12:52,540
Raja is our cousin

200
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,698
That is why I thought that this light and this glory has dimmed

201
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:57,419
Say the name

202
00:12:57,451 --> 00:12:59,745
My brother-in-law's daughter is Raja Kumari Meera

203
00:12:59,793 --> 00:13:02,096
Last year we left everyone behind and left the world

204
00:13:05,412 --> 00:13:06,150
wow

205
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:09,112
I said how

206
00:13:09,718 --> 00:13:11,257
How did you go?

207
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:12,560
A road accident

208
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:16,190
Since then, his soul feels like he is wandering

209
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:17,803
Talk to him once

210
00:13:21,538 --> 00:13:22,929
I can feel it

211
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:25,899
His soul is somewhere here..

212
00:13:25,924 --> 00:13:27,631
Raja Kumari Meera

213
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:32,500
Talk to me.. where are you?

214
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,101
Looks like he's embarrassed

215
00:13:34,896 --> 00:13:37,198
Where the hell is the switchboard?

216
00:13:37,223 --> 00:13:38,317
Meeroo

217
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:40,216
Meeroo

218
00:13:40,742 --> 00:13:43,512
Talk to me children.. Come here

219
00:13:46,336 --> 00:13:47,972
This... this

220
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:49,616
Here it is

221
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:52,285
Awa.. Where is Baba.. Meeru?

222
00:13:56,823 --> 00:13:58,292
hey

223
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:14,508
Tilloo

224
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,597
That same girl.. Oh my God, how quickly you died.. What a waste

225
00:14:25,622 --> 00:14:28,427
I'm sorry Meeroo.. Ram Ram

226
00:14:29,262 --> 00:14:31,176
He says.. What are you talking about?

227
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:33,455
What are you talking about?

228
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,981
Nothing special.. you seem busy.. see you later

229
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:38,411
Talked to me

230
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,405
Saying now

231
00:14:42,522 --> 00:14:43,414
A vampire

232
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,339
Bay.. Save

233
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:48,057
save me

234
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,095
I mean, uncle.. he is the number one cheater

235
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,003
completely

236
00:14:57,308 --> 00:15:00,443
are you alive
- Yes.. but you are dead

237
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:01,548
uncle

238
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:05,269
A vampire

239
00:15:05,857 --> 00:15:07,703
Aren't you ashamed?

240
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:09,444
Cheating on such a small person?

241
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:12,527
Do you have.. are you cheating the whole world?

242
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,452
what do you want
- Even knowing that you are the number one cheater..

243
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:19,051
We want to use your Baba service

244
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:22,418
And for that you have to go to our kingdom Raktaghat

245
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,485
Is my brain damaged, should I go to Raktaghat with you?

246
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,180
I'm not going anywhere
- Should I upload this first on Instagram or YouTube?

247
00:15:30,923 --> 00:15:31,684
Don't worry

248
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:35,274
If you do our work, we will give you one crore rupees

249
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:37,062
A crore?

250
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:39,724
What time is the flight?

251
00:15:50,238 --> 00:15:52,587
If you are done waiting, look elsewhere

252
00:15:52,612 --> 00:15:54,859
No, I wasn't waiting

253
00:15:54,884 --> 00:15:57,781
I'm just thinking.. if you are from a royal family..

254
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:02,253
Then why go by this train?
- We are not like other kings and queens

255
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:05,022
We do not think of the difference between our own sacrifices

256
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,498
Living simply..thinking big
- Great

257
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:12,233
Tell me one more thing.. even though you know I am number one..

258
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:14,475
The number one liar..

259
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:16,675
Then why are you taking me?

260
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:20,186
You will know when you go further

261
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:28,944
wow

262
00:16:29,842 --> 00:16:31,310
Raktghat

263
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:46,810
Look at that

264
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:53,125
Does everyone in this village have any disease?

265
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:56,353
Why was everyone staring at me?
- Will know

266
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:18,058
Let's go.. His Majesty is waiting for you

267
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:20,385
yes come
- Oh, not there

268
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:23,111
His Majesty is not in the palace

269
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:24,389
then?

270
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:38,507
Clay bungalow?
- What to say..

271
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:40,050
There is a demon in our palace

272
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:43,813
A demon?
- Manjulika.. so no one is there for fear

273
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:48,399
So the whole family had to move to the clay bungalow

274
00:17:48,424 --> 00:17:53,459
At one time, thousands of our cows were tied here..thousands

275
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:56,952
Now there is only one left.. Shaiga

276
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:01,290
Is this Shaiga?

277
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:03,135
Don't say that

278
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,618
Uncle.. It's time to take milk from him

279
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:10,445
Das
- Yes

280
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:24,444
Your cow does not give milk.. it drinks

281
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:28,549
Yes, he is weak and helpless
- Weak?

282
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:30,624
Whose stomach is itchy?

283
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:33,599
What is going on here?

284
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,960
Take it here sister.. Keep it for tomorrow

285
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:01,781
For tomorrow?

286
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:04,103
Oh, now you can drag on for another week

287
00:19:04,128 --> 00:19:05,265
You do something

288
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:07,560
keep mine

289
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,300
Oh, great

290
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:13,693
This will be good for the whole year
- Yes

291
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,261
asking

292
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:18,493
How did you build such a figure even though you are so poor?

293
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:20,509
Hey Paharaya.. talk with kindness..

294
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,724
We are princes of a royal family.. princes
- Oh bye

295
00:19:23,815 --> 00:19:26,865
Say anything you want in front of me.. but don't tell this prince story
(referring to the film Shehzada)

296
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,966
Attention..Accept.. The King of Raktghat

297
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:34,200
Getting comfortable..

298
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:36,876
May His Majesty win
- Hey, hey

299
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:39,658
Me and His Majesty

300
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:43,589
This is our bodyguard.. Pholad Singh

301
00:19:44,205 --> 00:19:46,634
This.. Pholad Singh?

302
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:49,112
He has been protecting us since the time of our grandfather

303
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:54,226
Now he is getting old, so we have to take good care of him
- What kind of state is this?

304
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:57,645
The cow has to be milked... it has to be protected

305
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,504
we

306
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:01,561
I have been waiting for you for a long time

307
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,152
Did you hear?

308
00:20:04,211 --> 00:20:07,438
You can talk to demons.. do it
- Can do

309
00:20:08,452 --> 00:20:11,992
Bhojana is waiting for you.. Come

310
00:20:12,614 --> 00:20:14,821
I felt very hungry, King

311
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:17,437
royal meals

312
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,719
Pholad Singh

313
00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:31,514
my bread

314
00:20:31,715 --> 00:20:33,509
I will protect you

315
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:34,909
Promised

316
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:38,179
If this bread is poisoned like that, you will die

317
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,312
shut up

318
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,387
I'm starving to death

319
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:47,764
God.. If you don't beg like this, Somalia wouldn't even exist

320
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,396
Raja Kumari's mother..

321
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:53,248
Raja Kumari

322
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:56,372
come here

323
00:20:58,493 --> 00:21:00,740
Please take some and eat this too

324
00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:01,862
What?

325
00:21:02,705 --> 00:21:04,397
You don't have a penny

326
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:05,919
How can you give me a crore?

327
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:08,692
You will get the answer in the evening

328
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:21,389
Pranam

329
00:21:28,414 --> 00:21:29,771
Namaste Pranam G

330
00:21:30,193 --> 00:21:32,114
This Rajapurohita G

331
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:35,213
Namaste Rajapurohita G

332
00:21:35,238 --> 00:21:37,690
I have been waiting for you since my previous self

333
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,973
But your story was written for my destiny

334
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,575
what are you doing bro

335
00:21:48,547 --> 00:21:49,658
I am thankful

336
00:21:50,716 --> 00:21:52,699
oh what's going on
- Shut up

337
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:55,153
come on

338
00:21:58,836 --> 00:22:01,519
I will not come
- Let's shut up

339
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:04,230
money

340
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:05,706
let's go

341
00:22:31,307 --> 00:22:32,061
let's go

342
00:22:52,608 --> 00:22:53,742


343
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,463
Did you see it?

344
00:23:00,496 --> 00:23:04,059
Where are you.. Oh, are you going to leave anyone alone?

345
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:05,541


346
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:32,367
This is not yours, this is a picture of the prince

347
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,721
Rajakumara Devendranath's house

348
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:37,469
You are his next birth

349
00:23:38,447 --> 00:23:39,487
After birth?

350
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,808
To understand that story, you have to know the history of this state

351
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:45,127
History

352
00:23:45,582 --> 00:23:47,788
Like Rajakumara Devendranath's..

353
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,856
Sister Manjulika's..

354
00:23:53,686 --> 00:23:56,848
Raja Kumari Manjulika is the only daughter of Maharaja

355
00:23:57,072 --> 00:24:00,866
An expert in the art of drama.. and the best on the battlefield

356
00:24:07,631 --> 00:24:11,067
No one in the entire state had a goal like him

357
00:24:16,918 --> 00:24:20,460
He knew that he would find the throne of the Maharaja in the future

358
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,521
Later, the Maharaja had a son from one of his maidservants

359
00:24:28,246 --> 00:24:29,493
Devendranath

360
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:32,494
Deboo..Deboo

361
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:35,021
His Majesty began to show him his kindness

362
00:24:35,796 --> 00:24:39,296
Deboo..Deboo

363
00:24:40,117 --> 00:24:41,141
take care

364
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:43,543
Hane is my little brother

365
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:48,756
Why are you crying on my sister's lap?

366
00:24:48,781 --> 00:24:51,284
my little brother

367
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,358
Even so, his faith was not broken

368
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:57,591
Because Devendranath's body had the blood of one hundred slaves

369
00:24:58,428 --> 00:24:59,618
But when the time comes

370
00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:05,568
Then the Maharaja handed over his crown to Devendranath

371
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:13,140
And that night, Manjulika killed her brother very cruelly

372
00:25:15,176 --> 00:25:17,065
What is the punishment to be given to him?

373
00:25:19,294 --> 00:25:20,350
Death penalty

374
00:25:30,774 --> 00:25:32,711
This is where he was burned

375
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:36,133
Everyone thought this was the end of the story

376
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:40,026
But even death could not stop Manjulika

377
00:25:40,815 --> 00:25:44,475
He came back to take his revenge

378
00:26:50,747 --> 00:26:55,295
Stop the spirit of Manjulika, my ancestors with one great puja

379
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,449
Pure oil was taken

380
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:48,343
And he was locked behind that door forever

381
00:27:51,415 --> 00:27:54,589
This Bhairav ​​Kavach will be able to stop Manjulika

382
00:27:54,813 --> 00:27:56,440
He cannot be destroyed

383
00:27:56,921 --> 00:27:59,230
And according to future astrologers..

384
00:27:59,255 --> 00:28:02,739
Someone will be reborn as a royal family to end Manjulika

385
00:28:03,227 --> 00:28:06,195
And he comes and opens this door on Durghashtmi day

386
00:28:07,503 --> 00:28:11,186
This kingdom has been waiting for you since the last 200 years

387
00:28:11,989 --> 00:28:13,704
me
- Yes

388
00:28:14,031 --> 00:28:15,976
Tomorrow is the first day of Durga Puja

389
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:18,629
Just like Madhurwale finished Maishasur..

390
00:28:18,927 --> 00:28:19,633
you too

391
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,705
Manjulika finishes

392
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:24,932
On a Durgashtami day

393
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:28,236
Don't even think of going near this gate before that

394
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:32,652
Oh, I won't even think about that.
- Why is Pandit ji talking about going near Manjulika?

395
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:35,228
Because you are not an ordinary person
- Then what am I?

396
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,134
You are the prince of this kingdom

397
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:38,208
Prince

398
00:28:38,812 --> 00:28:42,099
Prince.. Prince?

399
00:28:42,342 --> 00:28:44,516
You were born to do this

400
00:28:45,636 --> 00:28:47,263
What has to be done?

401
00:28:47,616 --> 00:28:49,172
End of Manjulika

402
00:28:50,047 --> 00:28:51,761
End of Manjulika

403
00:28:52,392 --> 00:28:54,122
Get to know yourself

404
00:28:56,315 --> 00:28:59,776
There is no need to worry about anyone here when you are there, Yuvarajuni

405
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:01,121
yes

406
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,068
No need to worry

407
00:29:09,934 --> 00:29:11,077
I am the prince

408
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:12,578
royal

409
00:29:13,054 --> 00:29:14,269
I have blue blood

410
00:29:15,345 --> 00:29:20,012
From my childhood, I knew that there was something special in me.. I was not an ordinary person

411
00:29:20,413 --> 00:29:22,175
But fate crept in

412
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:26,088
Today this life is passing in the middle.. Chi

413
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:27,824
Poor people

414
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:29,722
This is the lack of muscle

415
00:29:29,747 --> 00:29:31,525
I feel right now

416
00:29:32,974 --> 00:29:34,497
As soon as I said it, another girl was crying

417
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,927
what are you doing
- Shut up maid

418
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:40,272
the maid?
- Yes, and remember

419
00:29:40,473 --> 00:29:42,051
This palace is mine

420
00:29:42,713 --> 00:29:44,689
Not yours
- Hello

421
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:49,289
All these demonic reincarnations are nonsense.. they are all stupid things.. get it?

422
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:50,254
Does that mean?

423
00:29:50,643 --> 00:29:52,223
Don't you believe these things?

424
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,810
Definitely.. I don't believe it

425
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:58,172
If father had not promised, I would have gone and opened Manjulika's door for a long time.

426
00:29:58,914 --> 00:30:00,097
But it doesn't matter

427
00:30:00,374 --> 00:30:03,001
Now I need this blind faith

428
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:06,243
You open that door on Durgashtami day

429
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:08,071
Then this palace

430
00:30:09,122 --> 00:30:11,241
It will sell for at least 1000 crores

431
00:30:11,806 --> 00:30:13,251
1000 crores?

432
00:30:13,516 --> 00:30:16,476
Don't worry.. you will get your 1 crore

433
00:30:16,501 --> 00:30:17,717
1 crore?

434
00:30:18,473 --> 00:30:19,409
greedy woman

435
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:20,817
Hello.. Let's go

436
00:30:20,842 --> 00:30:24,382
Because of your self-confidence, the whole family wants to move to the palace

437
00:30:53,703 --> 00:30:56,187
We should not be here now

438
00:30:57,794 --> 00:31:00,762
How much time is left for Durgashtami?

439
00:31:01,145 --> 00:31:02,042
father

440
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:04,592
There is something else that scares me too

441
00:31:04,617 --> 00:31:08,396
what
- Higanakama.. Our whole life was spent in that clay bungalow..

442
00:31:08,709 --> 00:31:10,050
And why are you scared?

443
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:12,385
Now the prince is with us

444
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:17,884
Even so, if you have any problem, there is Folard Singh to protect you?

445
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,490
Where is Pholad Singh?

446
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:25,868
Where is Pholad Singh?

447
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,272
brother in law

448
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:32,551
Look what I brought

449
00:31:32,616 --> 00:31:35,974
This.. here
- Hey idiot

450
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:38,397
How much blood was taken and sold?

451
00:31:38,575 --> 00:31:41,321
Oh, the blood was not sold.. Donations were made. Oh, they were donated

452
00:31:41,346 --> 00:31:44,750
Donated?
- When the villagers found out..

453
00:31:44,775 --> 00:31:49,679
The prince has come with us to the palace.. People started donating again

454
00:31:49,704 --> 00:31:53,907
Great.. Does that mean you will always have food to eat at home?
- Of course

455
00:31:53,932 --> 00:31:56,950
Then we don't have to go to temples to pick up sandals?
- No

456
00:31:57,686 --> 00:32:01,559
Then we don't have to pick toffees from the trash cans for sweets?

457
00:32:04,684 --> 00:32:05,391
very good

458
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,060
Now, with this money, let's make some new additions to the palace

459
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:09,896
Let's go.. We also have to go to the God Mandir

460
00:32:09,921 --> 00:32:39,456
May the royal prince win

461
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,890
On the occasion of Durga Puja..

462
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:44,003
Every year

463
00:32:44,617 --> 00:32:47,744
The whole village has burnt Manjulika's pyre

464
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:52,368
But this time set it on fire.. themselves

465
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:54,646
The prince has come here

466
00:32:54,686 --> 00:32:56,995
Long live the royal prince!

467
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,344
Long live the royal prince!
- King Digvijaya

468
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:02,546
Who is there?

469
00:33:03,613 --> 00:33:04,351
hands down

470
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:14,335
What is a prince, how is a prince, where is a prince?

471
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:18,800
This is not any prince

472
00:33:20,842 --> 00:33:22,482
Leave the prince

473
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:26,370
Not even the royal prince's "foot".
- Where did the letter "pa" come from when you say prince?

474
00:33:26,403 --> 00:33:28,746
"Pa" comes from "pa"
(initial letter)

475
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,052
This is a thief... a fraud

476
00:33:31,077 --> 00:33:32,108
a liar

477
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:35,826
This is coming

478
00:33:36,122 --> 00:33:37,987
Memory.. come once

479
00:33:38,012 --> 00:33:39,647
This is a liar

480
00:33:39,672 --> 00:33:43,291
Come once.. Came
- This is a liar

481
00:33:45,037 --> 00:33:46,577
My coronation

482
00:33:47,253 --> 00:33:48,769
It happened in this house

483
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:51,582
the hand

484
00:33:52,065 --> 00:33:55,489
I went horse riding.. then that field was outside

485
00:33:56,095 --> 00:33:57,595
Kook fought

486
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,233
the hook
- Cockfighting

487
00:34:00,935 --> 00:34:04,128
Oh Lantoo, Puntoo and Tuntuny

488
00:34:04,153 --> 00:34:07,745
What lantu.. what puntu what tuntuni?

489
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:11,079
I am a small scholar.. a big scholar.. a scholar

490
00:34:11,459 --> 00:34:13,848
So this soul is crazy?

491
00:34:14,582 --> 00:34:18,725
In the past, you are Lantu, you are Puntu, then you are Tuntuni

492
00:34:19,697 --> 00:34:22,792
You massaged my hand.. your leg.. then you

493
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,083
Pawan Saluwa

494
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:29,586
Lies. Only lies.. I'm massaging your legs, not your hands

495
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:33,306
What did you say?
- Prove that he is a liar

496
00:34:33,331 --> 00:34:37,683
Well, let's say.. Then I am not your leg.. I am massaging your hand

497
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:41,409
Did you see? Did you see? The memory comes back a little

498
00:34:41,434 --> 00:34:44,230
You tighten your knees a little more

499
00:34:45,438 --> 00:34:46,889
Get full memory back..

500
00:34:46,914 --> 00:34:48,618
Because it can be of little use to our people

501
00:34:48,643 --> 00:34:51,470
What is good for us?
- How is that?

502
00:34:51,495 --> 00:34:55,630
In my departed soul, I handed over my treasure to these three people for my people

503
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:57,444
treasure
- Treasure?

504
00:34:57,469 --> 00:35:01,343
At least 30000 gold coins in that treasure..

505
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:04,379
There were diamonds, pearls, and all kinds of jewels

506
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:08,067
Before my people get my treasure..

507
00:35:08,092 --> 00:35:09,823
These three stole the treasure

508
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,721
Then hid.. and then..

509
00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:13,797
disappeared
- Disappeared?

510
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,187
Now if their memory comes back..

511
00:35:16,212 --> 00:35:20,588
Then we will know where these three have hidden the treasure.

512
00:35:20,613 --> 00:35:22,471
Where is our treasure hidden?

513
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,056
Where is the treasure?

514
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:29,404
Whose treasure and where is the treasure? This is all a conspiracy

515
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:30,569
Please stop, stop

516
00:35:30,594 --> 00:35:33,874
Why are you beating my family members like dogs?

517
00:35:34,275 --> 00:35:37,704
No one's memory of being hit like that will come back

518
00:35:37,873 --> 00:35:41,079
I read somewhere.. because I read a lot

519
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:45,528
If you do the things of the past soul again in this soul..

520
00:35:45,778 --> 00:35:48,019
Then people's memory can come back

521
00:35:48,128 --> 00:35:50,352
Just like my Ava.. right now

522
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:54,109
Yes, that's exactly right.. isn't it, uncle?
- 200% right.. right brother?

523
00:35:54,908 --> 00:35:57,598
yes good
- Yes, fine

524
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:02,443
Then the story became solid.. Now you three are sitting in my palace and serving me

525
00:36:02,468 --> 00:36:05,828
We are all together squeezing your neck

526
00:36:05,853 --> 00:36:08,737
Oh, if you don't go, how can we find the treasure?

527
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:46,489
Excuse me.. you?

528
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:54,732
Mallika.. came from crown heritage restoration..

529
00:39:55,094 --> 00:39:58,578
Yes.. this company restores old properties

530
00:39:58,603 --> 00:40:00,000
I also called further

531
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,424
But wasn't Kaushik ji supposed to come instead of you?

532
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:05,021
He went on a long vacation

533
00:40:05,196 --> 00:40:09,238
For a long vacation.. I talked to him yesterday.. Wait a second

534
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:19,072
Not getting it
- He said.. he went on a long vacation

535
00:40:19,096 --> 00:40:20,512
It's okay

536
00:40:20,796 --> 00:40:22,407
He will replace him

537
00:40:22,432 --> 00:40:24,884
welcome
- Come on

538
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:33,186
So you are the reincarnation of the prince?

539
00:40:33,752 --> 00:40:34,871
yes

540
00:40:35,494 --> 00:40:40,311
Did you remember anything about anyone.. Your father, His Majesty.. The rest of the relatives

541
00:40:40,336 --> 00:40:43,347
Or your sister Manjulika

542
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,069
No, it hasn't come yet

543
00:40:48,482 --> 00:40:51,435
will come
- Yes.. It's coming

544
00:40:51,747 --> 00:40:53,826
Come, let me show you to your room

545
00:41:52,147 --> 00:41:53,068
survived

546
00:42:10,618 --> 00:42:11,880
A cool place

547
00:42:14,558 --> 00:42:15,637
is it true

548
00:42:17,512 --> 00:42:19,584
Meera.. don't jump again

549
00:42:19,609 --> 00:42:21,362
There is a staircase to go down in the back

550
00:42:22,032 --> 00:42:25,622
I won't let you jump.. I won't let you jump..
- Move on.. Leave

551
00:42:25,647 --> 00:42:27,640
what are you doing
Looking for excuses to catch up?

552
00:42:27,689 --> 00:42:30,325
I thought you'd bounce back like last night

553
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,796
Last night.. Where did I go?

554
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:35,213
in my dream

555
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:38,978
So now you're dreaming of me dying, aren't you?

556
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:41,298
Whose bus is going in your dreams?

557
00:42:42,205 --> 00:42:44,617
If my bus goes in my dreams..

558
00:42:45,169 --> 00:42:49,733
You can't even imagine how you dream about yourself

559
00:42:53,757 --> 00:42:55,662
Are you looking for excuses to touch me?

560
00:42:55,966 --> 00:42:56,624
give up

561
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,070
no no

562
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:00,540
survived

563
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,138
You are a very big boy

564
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,466
a coward
- Crazy

565
00:43:10,399 --> 00:43:11,542
crazy

566
00:43:11,845 --> 00:43:15,454
Victory to the revolution.. Victory to the revolution..

567
00:43:15,479 --> 00:43:19,642
Our employer is a crook

568
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:21,162
You are stupid

569
00:43:21,186 --> 00:43:23,701
what are you saying

570
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:24,841
What's going on?

571
00:43:24,865 --> 00:43:28,563
Excuse me for getting the memory back
Have you made a point and made us your servants?

572
00:43:28,588 --> 00:43:33,482
Then you told us to do all the work

573
00:43:33,507 --> 00:43:36,864
We will not do this work from now on

574
00:43:36,888 --> 00:43:39,879
And the food is not prepared in any way

575
00:43:39,904 --> 00:43:42,842
You alone are evil

576
00:43:42,867 --> 00:43:44,631
Your work is done

577
00:43:44,656 --> 00:43:47,371
My hands like flowers have disappeared

578
00:43:47,396 --> 00:43:49,572
So it should have been said earlier

579
00:43:50,217 --> 00:43:53,804
I will find some other way to get your memory back

580
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:55,494
So find another one

581
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,502
Will you find a Hunter?
- Hunter said?

582
00:43:58,527 --> 00:44:01,377
A whip.. the whip is inside..

583
00:44:02,025 --> 00:44:05,795
Why a whip?
- When you make those mistakes in the departed soul..

584
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:07,739
Then they whipped your face

585
00:44:08,295 --> 00:44:10,992
Whips to the face?
- When two hundred or three hundred whips hit

586
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:13,176
The memory will return automatically

587
00:44:18,423 --> 00:44:20,463
Two hundred and fifty finished

588
00:44:20,488 --> 00:44:21,829
are you ok

589
00:44:21,854 --> 00:44:25,966
I'm fine.. Are you waiting for it to fly?

590
00:44:26,303 --> 00:44:31,624
listen listen..
- Dada Muni

591
00:44:31,649 --> 00:44:33,086
Dada Bro

592
00:44:33,111 --> 00:44:35,747
What do you like to eat?

593
00:44:35,772 --> 00:44:37,044
Palappanir

594
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:39,640
Or do you like paneer?
- Make both

595
00:44:40,215 --> 00:44:42,256
Kala will tell you what you like

596
00:44:42,281 --> 00:44:46,592
Well, hurry up and start working

597
00:45:03,843 --> 00:45:04,867
didn't you sleep

598
00:45:07,903 --> 00:45:10,173
Hey, no, no

599
00:45:11,343 --> 00:45:14,319
The curse of these things has come to me

600
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:17,744
He likes weapons very much

601
00:45:17,968 --> 00:45:20,643
No one in the entire state had a goal like his

602
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:25,789
Even with his eyes closed, he never lost sight of his goal

603
00:45:30,586 --> 00:45:31,768
Isn't it?

604
00:45:35,837 --> 00:45:39,527
What are you saying lady.. do you think you are Manjulika?

605
00:45:39,974 --> 00:45:44,437
Oh lady, it is not possible for everyone to achieve a goal like his

606
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:46,791
you sleep

607
00:46:12,168 --> 00:46:13,240
hello

608
00:46:13,502 --> 00:46:15,113
Rooh Baba is speaking

609
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:35,954
Welcome to our program

610
00:46:36,496 --> 00:46:37,782
Come let's talk

611
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,140
Our next conversation

612
00:46:44,522 --> 00:46:45,840
what is your name

613
00:46:46,492 --> 00:46:48,149
Yes.. Manjulika

614
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:50,651
Who do you want to message?

615
00:46:50,676 --> 00:46:52,972
to my brother

616
00:46:54,929 --> 00:46:59,312
My treasure..my dear brother

617
00:47:00,425 --> 00:47:02,274
You came back

618
00:47:02,411 --> 00:47:04,895
But you will not be saved

619
00:47:05,725 --> 00:47:07,566
I am out

620
00:47:07,855 --> 00:47:10,942
And you are listening

621
00:47:11,334 --> 00:47:14,819
Your death is written in this soul and my hand

622
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:18,167
Just like I died now you will die

623
00:47:18,207 --> 00:47:20,595
You will have to work hard

624
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:21,932
It will take a lot of drilling

625
00:47:21,957 --> 00:47:23,662
Oh, oh, oh

626
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:07,989
Black cat.. go away

627
00:48:08,398 --> 00:48:10,870
Black cat.. Run away.. Get out of here

628
00:48:11,943 --> 00:48:14,428
A fire broke out
- Where did it go now?

629
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:21,580
A fire broke out
- Oh, there's a fire

630
00:48:21,604 --> 00:48:23,816
A fire has started..come quickly come quickly

631
00:48:23,841 --> 00:48:25,319
A fire broke out

632
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:46,723
How did this painting spontaneously combust?

633
00:48:46,748 --> 00:48:51,085
The thing to think about is why did this painting catch fire?

634
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:53,470
This is done by Manjulika

635
00:48:53,495 --> 00:48:57,043
yes..
- He had an enmity with this prince

636
00:48:57,068 --> 00:48:59,279
Enmity
- I said infinite

637
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:01,053
We should not have stayed here

638
00:49:03,717 --> 00:49:05,448
oh oh oh

639
00:49:05,696 --> 00:49:08,331
Is it burnt? It's very sad

640
00:49:10,066 --> 00:49:14,911
You're not afraid of the painting, it's like you were on fire

641
00:49:16,462 --> 00:49:18,573
It's just a picture

642
00:49:36,856 --> 00:49:38,547
Damn.. I'm not lifting

643
00:49:39,597 --> 00:49:40,470
Oh Tilloo

644
00:49:40,653 --> 00:49:42,097
Why are you not answering my calls?

645
00:49:42,488 --> 00:49:43,750
Then why change this ringtone?

646
00:49:43,887 --> 00:49:45,688
Arahe threatens Manjulika on the radio

647
00:49:45,913 --> 00:49:48,246
Then the picture of Rajakumara Devendranath caught fire by itself

648
00:49:48,271 --> 00:49:48,994
That means me

649
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:49,741
what

650
00:49:50,784 --> 00:49:52,330
I had a very big belly

651
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:55,452
I'm royal.. you don't know

652
00:49:55,477 --> 00:49:59,639
I am leaving this maze.. you too are going.. time and time again
- Hello hello

653
00:49:59,793 --> 00:50:02,658
Don't even think of going back.. I ran away from there too..

654
00:50:02,683 --> 00:50:04,229
ran away.. why?

655
00:50:04,253 --> 00:50:06,210
Oh, there are clients who have caught us..

656
00:50:06,235 --> 00:50:09,467
He is brother of ACP Rathore..
- Which ACP Rathore?

657
00:50:09,492 --> 00:50:10,842
Oh, what do I know?

658
00:50:10,867 --> 00:50:12,749
Isn't ACP enough?

659
00:50:12,774 --> 00:50:16,990
I heard that it is very dangerous

660
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:20,884
Oh boy.. ACP Rathore on one side

661
00:50:20,909 --> 00:50:23,832
And on the other hand, Manjulika.. what am I doing?

662
00:50:24,524 --> 00:50:28,043
Let's do something.. Let's go somewhere and hide.. Let's think later

663
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:32,833
But before that, delete that ghost video of yours from that Bhutini's phone

664
00:50:33,424 --> 00:50:34,202
good

665
00:50:34,576 --> 00:50:37,662
Then what did you say about that manjulika.. who is she?

666
00:50:37,687 --> 00:50:39,173
Oh, he is a number one monster

667
00:50:39,546 --> 00:50:42,369
A witch, a ghost, a rassi
He comes as soon as he sees blood

668
00:50:56,615 --> 00:50:57,766
Hey Rasgullah

669
00:50:58,005 --> 00:50:59,600
Down time.. Down time

670
00:51:00,086 --> 00:51:01,102
is coming

671
00:51:01,769 --> 00:51:02,340
What?

672
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:05,447
Will you do something for me?
- Why?

673
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:07,291
ask

674
00:51:07,569 --> 00:51:09,125
I want your sister's phone

675
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:12,310
But he can't know.. Take it, son

676
00:51:12,678 --> 00:51:13,234
the fruit

677
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:15,188
I have honest blood

678
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:17,029
It is full of loyalty

679
00:51:17,627 --> 00:51:18,516
you want

680
00:51:18,652 --> 00:51:20,216
Should I cheat on my sister?

681
00:51:20,454 --> 00:51:21,478
20 will be given

682
00:51:24,518 --> 00:51:25,089
ok

683
00:51:28,562 --> 00:51:31,351
Oh, not blood.. there was chutney.. chutney
- Are you sure?

684
00:51:31,376 --> 00:51:33,262
Have you brought it, son.. Great

685
00:51:34,439 --> 00:51:36,335
The password?
- Another Rs.20 goes

686
00:51:38,993 --> 00:51:40,104
rob me

687
00:51:42,487 --> 00:51:43,924
1234

688
00:52:12,132 --> 00:52:15,044
I knew you would definitely try to steal my phone

689
00:52:15,555 --> 00:52:17,642
Fortunately, I had left a password

690
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:19,890
don't you like me

691
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:20,590
what

692
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,695
Not at all

693
00:52:22,768 --> 00:52:23,577
why

694
00:52:23,714 --> 00:52:26,476
Because what you see is one and another

695
00:52:26,999 --> 00:52:29,083
It's hard to understand you

696
00:52:29,348 --> 00:52:31,419
But I understand you very well

697
00:52:31,444 --> 00:52:33,706
Hello.. Don't try to understand too much

698
00:52:33,731 --> 00:52:36,916
Just understand this, as long as this video of yours is on my phone..

699
00:52:36,941 --> 00:52:38,595
Don't even think about leaving here

700
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,041
In any case, Ruh Baba's appearance makes me look like a bastard

701
00:52:42,098 --> 00:52:42,677
right?

702
00:52:48,619 --> 00:52:49,905
I don't know about the video

703
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:53,581
But as long as you have my photos on your phone..

704
00:52:53,821 --> 00:52:54,829
I'm not going anywhere

705
00:53:24,338 --> 00:53:30,685
<i>Nobody came..ever after you..</i>

706
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:36,716
<i>The city of this heart.. is empty..</i>

707
00:53:36,741 --> 00:53:42,692
<i>Your dreams.. in those moments..</i>

708
00:53:42,717 --> 00:53:48,600
<i><font color="

709
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:54,590

710
00:53:54,614 --> 00:54:00,676
<i>My love for you increased a little..</i>

711
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:06,679
<i>Goed without fruit.. without goal.. without purpose..</i>

712
00:54:06,704 --> 00:54:14,162
<i>My love for you increased a little..</i>

713
00:54:27,526 --> 00:54:34,036

714
00:54:34,061 --> 00:54:39,723

00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:57,463
<i>This soul is yours..</i>

717
00:54:57,488 --> 00:55:05,494
<i>Your rights have never been claimed..</i>

718
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:12,636
<i>I will not fight with loneliness.. I will not fight with memories..</i>

719
00:55:12,661 --> 00:55:18,516
<i>She who has become a shadow.. She is far from me even when I am close..</i>

720
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:24,613

00:55:47,823 --> 00:55:49,307
Who is the girl in this picture?

723
00:55:49,706 --> 00:55:51,848
Madhulika Devi
- Manjulica

724
00:55:52,263 --> 00:55:54,056
Madhulika Devi

725
00:55:54,788 --> 00:55:56,773
Wife of Rajakumara Devendranath

726
00:55:57,331 --> 00:55:58,521
Oh my wife

727
00:55:59,015 --> 00:56:00,475
Not very hot please..

728
00:56:04,332 --> 00:56:08,943
But her lips suit you very well

729
00:56:09,326 --> 00:56:12,598
You're not like that, are you?
- Want to talk nonsense all the time?

730
00:56:12,623 --> 00:56:16,460
Oh, you said it's hot.. I didn't catch it.. Please listen

731
00:56:16,988 --> 00:56:18,869
I don't want to hear anything.. You go

732
00:56:18,894 --> 00:56:21,292
Oh, where are you going.. Oh, Manjulika's room

733
00:56:28,247 --> 00:56:31,064
This is there

734
00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:33,090
this..
- Bhairav ​​Kavach

735
00:56:40,538 --> 00:56:41,720
should have gone

736
00:56:45,288 --> 00:56:46,511
Said to go

737
00:56:48,061 --> 00:56:49,783
You will not be saved

738
00:57:59,112 --> 00:58:00,318
Let go of me

739
00:58:02,934 --> 00:58:04,299
what are you doing

740
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,832
let me go

741
00:58:10,577 --> 00:58:13,375
Where are you taking...Manjulika is there

742
00:58:13,399 --> 00:58:14,537
should have gone

743
00:58:15,715 --> 00:58:18,931
They asked you to go.. Did you bring someone else with you?

744
00:58:19,697 --> 00:58:20,871
going to go

745
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:24,414
Oh, why don't you go?

746
00:58:24,455 --> 00:58:29,378
Oh my throat hurts.. Please go away

747
00:58:29,403 --> 00:58:33,826
You beat me.. my treasure

748
00:58:33,851 --> 00:58:35,473
my treasure you

749
00:58:35,498 --> 00:58:38,030
Oh, he is not alone.. we are there too

750
00:58:38,055 --> 00:58:41,764
My sister-in-law was killed..
- Are the three of you scary from the beginning?

751
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:44,101
Oh scary means we were scared too

752
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:48,079
After spending such a pleasant time.. you have come to the middle

753
00:58:48,104 --> 00:58:49,687
Stupid thieves

754
00:58:49,923 --> 00:58:53,411
Since when do these?
- I have to tell the truth

755
00:58:53,436 --> 00:58:55,288
When did your mother die?
- Mine?

756
00:58:55,313 --> 00:58:56,432
Two years ago

757
00:58:56,457 --> 00:58:58,915
two years
- Two years

758
00:58:58,939 --> 00:59:03,135
Sister.. We really came here from a long way..

759
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,758
The color changed after seeing the weather

760
00:59:05,783 --> 00:59:06,632
Of course

761
00:59:07,191 --> 00:59:10,604
Two years ago we came in our Rolls Royce..

762
00:59:10,788 --> 00:59:13,758
In a Rolls Royce?
- Yes, we have two sisters

763
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:16,062
One is Rolls.. Another is Royce

764
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:20,774
There was a problem where we were sitting

765
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:25,111
So while leaving, got caught in the storm

766
00:59:25,136 --> 00:59:29,092
He crept inside the palace to escape the storm

767
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:43,409
oh god
- What did you see?

768
00:59:43,434 --> 00:59:47,205
This is Manjulika's palace
- Who is Manjulika?

769
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:49,844
The most famous ghost in this village

770
00:59:52,334 --> 00:59:55,201
I am yours

771
00:59:57,337 --> 00:59:58,257
shut up

772
00:59:58,808 --> 01:00:00,713
What if those ghouls come and catch you?

773
01:00:01,947 --> 01:00:04,201
Been with you for 35 years

774
01:00:04,916 --> 01:00:06,781
Now what will that ghoul do to me?

775
01:00:07,759 --> 01:00:09,224
Whatever else you do..

776
01:00:09,566 --> 01:00:11,646
feel happy

777
01:00:13,253 --> 01:00:16,824
But how did the lock break?
- The other incident lock

778
01:00:17,321 --> 01:00:22,839
Rajapurohita's ancestors put a big lock on the door

779
01:00:23,041 --> 01:00:26,724
It may rust over time and break on its own

780
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:28,751
And Manjulika?
- When we get inside..

781
01:00:28,776 --> 01:00:30,864
Manjulika was not there then

782
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:34,280
Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal for Mumtaz

783
01:00:34,305 --> 01:00:36,799
Our Manjulika is for us..

784
01:00:36,823 --> 01:00:38,655
Home sweet home
(beautiful house)

785
01:00:45,038 --> 01:00:47,744
Keep fearing Manjulika

786
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,604
I put on a bigger lock than myself

787
01:00:51,369 --> 01:00:54,655
Because no beggar like us..

788
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,010
Come here to get lost

789
01:00:57,537 --> 01:01:00,243
Then you came to set fire to our happiness

790
01:01:00,268 --> 01:01:04,316
If you open the room on Durshatmi day, our truth will be revealed

791
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:09,020
God.. How many games did you play to kick him out?

792
01:01:14,553 --> 01:01:17,228
Just like Albert Hitchcock.

793
01:01:17,253 --> 01:01:19,453
Scare him like that

794
01:01:22,904 --> 01:01:23,793
got caught

795
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:28,017
The robber got scared and ran away

796
01:01:28,307 --> 01:01:32,077
Are you scared?
- Yes.. The thief was afraid

797
01:01:35,036 --> 01:01:36,631
Rooh Baba

798
01:01:36,965 --> 01:01:39,187
I will take your soul out today

799
01:01:44,124 --> 01:01:47,180
But you were a great man

800
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:49,485
The other one slapped me

801
01:01:50,887 --> 01:01:52,411
Hey little sister

802
01:01:53,874 --> 01:01:56,795
How did you know we scared you too?

803
01:01:57,432 --> 01:01:59,988
Because I know you are not Manjulika

804
01:02:00,913 --> 01:02:03,516
Akkanam was taken away

805
01:02:05,267 --> 01:02:09,196
Well then.. The whole story was told and understood

806
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:11,412
Now it's time for us to sleep

807
01:02:11,509 --> 01:02:13,485
You guys leave our house

808
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:14,384
Good night

809
01:02:14,585 --> 01:02:17,617
Good night's little ones

810
01:02:17,642 --> 01:02:18,459
Thieves

811
01:02:19,453 --> 01:02:23,440
You scare me by wearing a cloth and sitting in the dark

812
01:02:23,927 --> 01:02:26,856
Go now and tell your father about these people..
- Where are you going?

813
01:02:27,113 --> 01:02:30,494
Why are you trying to screw up my million? You love me, don't you?

814
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:35,311
Let's tell this to father, uncle and the whole village.. tomorrow

815
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:36,734
But for my style

816
01:02:40,145 --> 01:02:44,082
Mallika G.. You solved all our problems by revealing the truth of these people

817
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,434
I can do that much for you

818
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,882
You are like my little brother.

819
01:02:51,243 --> 01:02:54,402
Then you do one more favor
- What?

820
01:02:55,501 --> 01:02:57,144
Some time tomorrow

821
01:02:57,509 --> 01:02:57,914
to you

822
01:02:58,488 --> 01:02:59,742
Can it be Manjulika?

823
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:01,903
i am

824
01:03:02,722 --> 01:03:03,746
Manjulica?

825
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:13,312
what happened
- Nothing

826
01:03:14,219 --> 01:03:15,219
will be

827
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:17,730
thank you

828
01:03:26,932 --> 01:03:28,202
Villagers

829
01:03:28,973 --> 01:03:32,775
I thought a lot about waiting for Durgashtmi to open the door

830
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:36,265
But you have been waiting for 200 years

831
01:03:36,448 --> 01:03:37,781
So why waste time?

832
01:03:38,443 --> 01:03:40,483
That's why this door is open today..

833
01:03:40,755 --> 01:03:43,938
I always close Manjulika's story

834
01:03:43,997 --> 01:03:47,243
Raja Purohita said clearly
- Calm down

835
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:50,262
I know this work is very difficult

836
01:03:50,287 --> 01:03:52,663
So help me in this work..

837
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:55,699
Village Maha..
The three Pandits

838
01:03:55,724 --> 01:04:00,114
A round of applause
- Come on Pandit G.. What's wrong with no sound?

839
01:04:00,139 --> 01:04:04,176
Pranaam.. Pranaam

840
01:04:04,201 --> 01:04:05,742
Please welcome

841
01:04:05,767 --> 01:04:09,092
Thank you..have some respect
- Not there

842
01:04:09,294 --> 01:04:12,459
Big pundit till I do the pooja part..

843
01:04:12,484 --> 01:04:16,493
Take a walk in the glowing stone fireplaces
- Good.. I will

844
01:04:16,517 --> 01:04:17,973
Then the little Pandit too

845
01:04:18,074 --> 01:04:20,523
Sit on the plate and pay attention

846
01:04:20,547 --> 01:04:26,196
Then you are Pandita.. Spin around on the floor

847
01:04:26,221 --> 01:04:30,177
Why did you make me do this?
- I don't

848
01:04:30,202 --> 01:04:32,364
I won't do it
- Don't you?

849
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:36,073
You liars

850
01:04:36,098 --> 01:04:38,139
Tell everyone your real image?

851
01:04:38,269 --> 01:04:40,787
Are you going to destroy us?

852
01:04:40,812 --> 01:04:48,245
For little pundits.. for big pundits.. for pundits
win

853
01:04:51,203 --> 01:04:53,711
Go.. Go to start

854
01:04:53,863 --> 01:04:55,800
Go straight

855
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:58,573
Go.. roll over

856
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,547
Fire.. to the skin

857
01:05:11,267 --> 01:05:12,529
hurry up

858
01:05:16,059 --> 01:05:19,282
Hey, it's not a game, it's a sacrifice

859
01:05:19,307 --> 01:05:22,324
Light the Havan.. Havan
- Will you find a lighter?

860
01:05:22,583 --> 01:05:25,424
Oh, is there anyone.. someone who smokes beedi cigarettes.. is there a lighter?

861
01:05:25,769 --> 01:05:27,484
Burning fire

862
01:05:27,848 --> 01:05:29,286
Light these up

863
01:05:44,361 --> 01:05:46,099
This thief is making a noise

864
01:05:58,827 --> 01:05:59,439
enough

865
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:00,875
Manjulica

866
01:06:01,465 --> 01:06:02,802
Now your game is over

867
01:06:13,024 --> 01:06:13,968
stops

868
01:06:19,772 --> 01:06:20,503
enough

869
01:06:22,482 --> 01:06:23,990
Ahead is dangerous

870
01:06:27,047 --> 01:06:28,023
Manju

871
01:06:28,383 --> 01:06:30,256
I am coming to you

872
01:06:30,304 --> 01:06:32,411
Actin should be kept properly

873
01:06:32,435 --> 01:06:34,352
Ok then.. Action

874
01:06:34,377 --> 01:06:36,268
Manjulika comes out

875
01:06:39,449 --> 01:06:41,989
How long have you been hiding behind the door?

876
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:43,904
Speak Bengali?

877
01:06:47,741 --> 01:06:50,665
Did you lose the sound, Manju? Were you scared?

878
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:53,547
do you scare me

879
01:06:55,433 --> 01:06:57,242
do you scare me

880
01:06:59,247 --> 01:07:02,390
You don't know the fire inside me

881
01:07:02,415 --> 01:07:06,989
I will burn you and the whole family with that fire

882
01:07:09,487 --> 01:07:13,721
When your body is set on fire..

883
01:07:13,746 --> 01:07:14,524
the body?

884
01:07:14,549 --> 01:07:17,899
When taken from your bones..

885
01:07:17,924 --> 01:07:21,317
That's when I find peace

886
01:07:21,342 --> 01:07:24,485
Debu will finish you off

887
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:27,831
It's completely undone

888
01:07:27,856 --> 01:07:30,396
None of you will be left behind

889
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:32,740
No one will be left behind..

890
01:07:32,765 --> 01:07:35,101
No one will be left behind..

891
01:08:04,377 --> 01:08:06,004
Manjulika jumped

892
01:08:08,419 --> 01:08:10,752
That woman was kicked out

893
01:08:12,211 --> 01:08:16,794
To the prince
- Good luck

894
01:08:16,819 --> 01:08:19,057
great

895
01:08:23,992 --> 01:08:24,810
I said

896
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,533
Do not open this gate before Durgashtmi day

897
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:31,808
Look, Raja Purohita.. I respect you a lot

898
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:33,348
So nothing is hidden from you

899
01:08:33,765 --> 01:08:36,828
The real story is that Manjulika's story is false

900
01:08:36,853 --> 01:08:39,673
All the pandits of that village get together and make a Nadagam

901
01:08:40,073 --> 01:08:41,645
The door was open

902
01:08:44,872 --> 01:08:45,983
That means

903
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,217
Manjulika had already come out

904
01:08:50,821 --> 01:08:52,646
He is waiting for someone

905
01:08:53,292 --> 01:08:54,308
who

906
01:08:56,608 --> 01:08:57,687
Maybe yours

907
01:08:59,950 --> 01:09:03,220
I feel Manjulika is somewhere

908
01:09:03,409 --> 01:09:05,544
And they set their next trap

909
01:09:37,389 --> 01:09:38,437
what happened

910
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,367
It seems to be some sort of secret passage

911
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:43,519
Let's see.. what is the hidden secret

912
01:09:44,586 --> 01:09:45,927
It seems to be some sort of secret passage

913
01:10:08,993 --> 01:10:10,199
great

914
01:10:10,869 --> 01:10:13,249
When one door opened, another closed

915
01:10:13,656 --> 01:10:16,315
This castle of yours feels more extreme than a maze

916
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:19,739
Raja Purohita.. What are these things?

917
01:10:21,188 --> 01:10:23,148
Now there is no answer for me

918
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:26,988
For that I built the gate of the Maharaja..

919
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:31,711
You have to go to that settlement.. the history of the entire kingdom is hidden

920
01:10:33,209 --> 01:10:36,606
The answer will be found there.. but pay attention to one thing

921
01:10:38,015 --> 01:10:41,611
Don't even think of opening this door until Durgashtmi

922
01:10:44,753 --> 01:10:45,618
will go

923
01:10:57,528 --> 01:11:00,417
Tell me.. welcome

924
01:11:01,731 --> 01:11:04,985
Called the entire market to sell the palace

925
01:11:05,892 --> 01:11:07,717
Then this second door came

926
01:11:08,221 --> 01:11:09,944
Destroys

927
01:11:10,231 --> 01:11:11,009
yes

928
01:11:11,304 --> 01:11:13,272
But there is no way to open the door

929
01:11:13,297 --> 01:11:15,266
His high priest said no

930
01:11:15,516 --> 01:11:18,683
Let's hurry Tillu.. I have to catch the Hawada Express at 10.. Yaman son.

931
01:11:19,084 --> 01:11:21,931
But why are you going back?

932
01:11:23,152 --> 01:11:25,446
I can't stay in the dark now

933
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:29,026
In the dark?
- This one is burning now

934
01:11:29,521 --> 01:11:31,021
Cut later

935
01:11:31,396 --> 01:11:32,912
Can't pay the bill

936
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:35,843
When I found out about the second door..

937
01:11:35,868 --> 01:11:37,591
No one will give gifts

938
01:11:37,616 --> 01:11:41,055
And when the gift givers come back to ask for their money..

939
01:11:41,113 --> 01:11:42,517
How do you pay, poor people?

940
01:11:43,546 --> 01:11:46,752
After selling the blood, all the blood of my uncle is gone

941
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,889
Oh, but he is the one who gives blood

942
01:11:48,914 --> 01:11:50,471
How do you give?

943
01:11:51,036 --> 01:11:53,037
Look how much blood is left with the king

944
01:11:53,062 --> 01:11:56,651
Oh, what a king, what kind of a king.. He has become a crook even more than us

945
01:11:56,676 --> 01:11:58,473
With a sense.. Nadichcha Eko

946
01:11:58,678 --> 01:12:00,900
He is weaker than before

947
01:12:00,925 --> 01:12:05,078
He might have gone back to the clay bungalow and had some snacks

948
01:12:05,103 --> 01:12:09,456
He may be using the toothpaste we gave him for 5 years.. but don't forget this

949
01:12:09,481 --> 01:12:11,745
The king is the king

950
01:12:12,702 --> 01:12:14,591
How much do you respect me?

951
01:12:15,586 --> 01:12:18,991
Then why not help?
- The king is helping

952
01:12:19,122 --> 01:12:23,375
You don't know our Ruh Baba's anger
- Anger?

953
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,609
What do you want to say now, Mr. King?

954
01:12:26,287 --> 01:12:30,708
When going through a graveyard, big, big ghosts, ghosts, ghosts..

955
01:12:30,733 --> 01:12:33,681
Take the legs back and go back

956
01:12:34,127 --> 01:12:39,185
After going to 15 villages, the vampires tell their children to sleep.

957
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:42,319
Sleep little ghost.. or Ruh Baba will come

958
01:12:42,919 --> 01:12:47,292
But there is no way for me to open the second door.. because the Raja Purohita said no

959
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,337
Alas, Raja Purohita did not even know about the second door

960
01:12:52,119 --> 01:12:53,937
You can't live poor now

961
01:12:54,407 --> 01:12:57,161
You open the door... let's take care of something else

962
01:12:57,497 --> 01:12:59,116
As per your command, King

963
01:12:59,285 --> 01:13:02,460
Tellu.. tell Meera and uncle
- Okay

964
01:14:37,303 --> 01:14:38,089
did you see

965
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,098
I said

966
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:42,584
nothing

967
01:14:42,767 --> 01:14:45,267
What have you done?
- The door is open, what else are you doing?

968
01:14:45,292 --> 01:14:46,284
what are you doing

969
01:14:47,064 --> 01:14:47,763
a disaster

970
01:14:49,266 --> 01:14:49,916
a disaster

971
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:53,118
there

972
01:14:53,143 --> 01:14:56,080
I got to know something that no one else knew

973
01:14:56,773 --> 01:14:58,043
Not one for His Majesty

974
01:14:58,666 --> 01:14:59,983
Had two daughters

975
01:15:00,634 --> 01:15:01,992
Rajakumari Anjulika

976
01:15:02,733 --> 01:15:04,488
And Rajakumari Manjulika

977
01:15:15,533 --> 01:15:17,295
Little sister is a storm

978
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:19,424
Then the big sister

979
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:21,346
a fire

980
01:15:29,493 --> 01:15:32,604
If you know the details from one of them, you can dismiss it

981
01:15:32,868 --> 01:15:34,066
Then the other person's

982
01:15:35,371 --> 01:15:37,196
Still don't know

983
01:15:51,404 --> 01:15:54,301
After opening this door, one thing can be said for sure

984
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:56,050
Now the beginning of destruction

985
01:15:56,472 --> 01:15:57,226
certain

986
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:32,320
200 years ago

987
01:16:32,651 --> 01:16:39,529
You are all welcome to the palace of Maharaja Suprabud of Raktghat

988
01:16:39,554 --> 01:16:45,278
Today, a magnificent art exhibition will be presented in the King's palace

989
01:16:45,303 --> 01:16:49,239
Rajakumari Manjulika and Rajakumari Anjulika

990
01:17:37,638 --> 01:17:46,448
<i>Without you, my heart is a wasteland..</i>

991
01:17:46,473 --> 01:17:54,376
<i>I am like dry sand.. You are moisture..</i>

992
01:17:54,401 --> 01:18:03,255
<i>Without you, my heart is a wasteland..</i>

993
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:10,426
<i>I am like dry sand.. You are moisture..</i>

994
01:18:10,451 --> 01:18:14,872
<i>From the art of silence..your voice comes..</i>

995
01:18:14,896 --> 01:18:19,084
<i><font color="

996
01:18:19,109 --> 01:18:23,265
What is my life?
It is on you..</i>

997
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:27,451
<i>Even if I want.. I can't quench this lifelong desire..</i>

998
01:18:27,476 --> 01:18:32,432
<i>Soduraneni..</i>

999
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:36,426
<i>Ask my dear..</i>

1000
01:18:36,451 --> 01:18:41,017
<i>The melody of my love..</i>

1001
01:18:41,042 --> 01:18:44,792
<i><font color="

1002
01:18:44,817 --> 01:18:49,010
<i>My desires are..</i>

1003
01:18:49,035 --> 01:18:53,483
<i>flows through the atmosphere..</i>

1004
01:18:53,508 --> 01:18:57,671
<i>Alive..</i>

1005
01:18:57,696 --> 01:19:00,841
<i>Even after destruction..</i>

1006
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:11,917
<i>Ask my dear..</i>

1007
01:19:11,942 --> 01:19:16,423
<i>The melody of my love..</i>

1008
01:19:16,448 --> 01:19:20,281
<i>Ask my dear..</i>

1009
01:19:20,306 --> 01:19:24,468
<i><font color="

1010
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:28,580
<i>flows through the atmosphere..</i>

1011
01:19:28,605 --> 01:19:32,743
<i>Alive..</i>

1012
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:36,616
<i>Even after destruction..</i>

1013
01:19:43,508 --> 01:19:47,444
<i>I am yours..</i>

1014
01:19:47,469 --> 01:19:51,965
<i>Only yours..</i>

1015
01:19:51,990 --> 01:20:00,356
<i>I am yours..</i>

1016
01:20:56,837 --> 01:21:00,277
<i>I am yours..</i>

1017
01:21:00,309 --> 01:21:02,600
Excellent..excellent

1018
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:05,604
Happy with your dance..

1019
01:21:05,629 --> 01:21:08,234
I am going to give you both a surprise

1020
01:21:08,649 --> 01:21:10,427
I declare..

1021
01:21:10,604 --> 01:21:14,747
On the day of Durghashtami Puja, I am my royal throne

1022
01:21:15,118 --> 01:21:17,546
Handing over to the new prince

1023
01:21:17,591 --> 01:21:21,250
May the King win.. May the King win

1024
01:21:21,275 --> 01:21:25,640
That prince is.. your beloved

1025
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,128
my son

1026
01:21:29,290 --> 01:21:31,560
Rajakumara Devendranath

1027
01:21:31,585 --> 01:21:52,182
May the King win.. May the King win

1028
01:22:01,396 --> 01:22:04,341
the present

1029
01:22:08,776 --> 01:22:12,794
Two doors were found.. Two of them left early.. Then these two sat and watched TV

1030
01:22:41,191 --> 01:22:42,310
baby

1031
01:22:53,133 --> 01:22:55,212
Look behind

1032
01:22:57,350 --> 01:22:58,945
Look behind

1033
01:23:01,077 --> 01:23:03,355
Look behind

1034
01:23:06,694 --> 01:23:07,885
were you scared

1035
01:23:09,164 --> 01:23:10,283
did you come

1036
01:23:12,405 --> 01:23:14,945
You are the lady of Maharaj Mandira in Surigarh

1037
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:16,590
The one who wants to take our palace

1038
01:23:17,354 --> 01:23:19,402
I was very anxious to meet you

1039
01:23:19,815 --> 01:23:23,264
Restless?
- Just wanted to say thank you

1040
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:24,328
thank you

1041
01:23:24,711 --> 01:23:26,354
to me
- Yes

1042
01:23:26,802 --> 01:23:28,904
If you don't open that door..

1043
01:23:29,518 --> 01:23:31,510
Then I will never be able to come

1044
01:23:31,909 --> 01:23:34,782
Does that mean?
- That means you opened the door

1045
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,682
Manjulika jumped

1046
01:23:36,707 --> 01:23:38,803
That is why I was able to come here to buy the palace

1047
01:23:39,975 --> 01:23:41,483
I heard the other..

1048
01:23:41,912 --> 01:23:43,920
You can talk to demons

1049
01:23:44,247 --> 01:23:47,830
yes..
- That means when a demon appears in front of you

1050
01:23:47,855 --> 01:23:49,594
Will you catch him?

1051
01:23:49,883 --> 01:23:53,201
Yes.. definitely
- Delicious

1052
01:23:53,305 --> 01:23:54,806
Very tasty

1053
01:23:55,007 --> 01:23:58,142
Mrs. Mandira.. we have prepared a special room for you

1054
01:23:58,376 --> 01:24:00,349
Everything is ready

1055
01:24:00,374 --> 01:24:03,846
yes
- Can I stay in Manjulika's room?

1056
01:24:06,656 --> 01:24:08,568
why
- Just

1057
01:24:08,982 --> 01:24:10,625
The one in that room..

1058
01:24:10,722 --> 01:24:12,992
A demon had been locked up for so many years

1059
01:24:13,185 --> 01:24:15,392
The fun of being there will be different

1060
01:24:15,575 --> 01:24:16,162
right?

1061
01:24:17,276 --> 01:24:19,443
Yes, we have no problem

1062
01:24:19,468 --> 01:24:21,302
From here you are directly..
- know

1063
01:24:25,167 --> 01:24:27,825
He knows.. How does he know?

1064
01:25:42,571 --> 01:25:45,389
What will happen to Amma?

1065
01:25:54,599 --> 01:25:55,409
what is this

1066
01:26:04,228 --> 01:26:05,268
Look, he came

1067
01:26:06,151 --> 01:26:07,485
This is what could have happened

1068
01:26:08,025 --> 01:26:10,390
This is the first symbol

1069
01:26:12,063 --> 01:26:12,809
I said

1070
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:16,263
Don't open that door
- Speak slowly, High Priest

1071
01:26:16,988 --> 01:26:18,837
People are coming to take the palace

1072
01:26:19,037 --> 01:26:21,426
If someone hears something, that's it..

1073
01:26:21,738 --> 01:26:23,262
Everything is destroyed

1074
01:26:24,582 --> 01:26:26,995
Then for today.. have mercy

1075
01:26:27,086 --> 01:26:29,356
Only one person can help you

1076
01:26:29,555 --> 01:26:29,992
who

1077
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:31,978
That's not me

1078
01:26:32,734 --> 01:26:33,361
This one

1079
01:26:33,751 --> 01:26:35,053
What kind of buffalo is this?

1080
01:26:35,078 --> 01:26:36,990
what cow
- A buffalo

1081
01:26:37,015 --> 01:26:39,048
Why do you always put me first?

1082
01:26:39,304 --> 01:26:40,630
How do I kill him?

1083
01:26:40,655 --> 01:26:42,472
That's how you kill him.. Like

1084
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:44,887
Manjulika as an end to the departed soul

1085
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:50,845
Ginitiala.. This time we have to burn his soul and not his body

1086
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:53,048
The knowledge of our sciences..

1087
01:26:53,232 --> 01:26:57,608
By making a weapon.. I make my ancestors and do the magic again

1088
01:26:57,984 --> 01:27:01,855
Then pure oil comes out from the burning fire

1089
01:27:02,343 --> 01:27:03,962
They are written

1090
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:06,946
The last chapter of Manjulika's story

1091
01:27:08,617 --> 01:27:11,681
But until then, stay safe

1092
01:27:12,297 --> 01:27:13,226
because to me

1093
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:16,727
I feel that he has come out

1094
01:27:18,254 --> 01:27:19,516
hey hey

1095
01:27:21,552 --> 01:27:22,524
His look

1096
01:27:23,911 --> 01:27:25,256
You all have it

1097
01:27:39,533 --> 01:27:42,311
This is the most beautiful place in our village

1098
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:45,511
This place you see is the oldest house

1099
01:27:45,776 --> 01:27:47,752
let's go
- I'm not going to the mansion

1100
01:27:48,875 --> 01:27:49,716
why

1101
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,963
I don't believe in God

1102
01:27:52,419 --> 01:27:54,609
Mandira is called Mandira in your name

1103
01:27:54,875 --> 01:27:58,018
Let's think of it as a tourist station.. Come on
- I said that I will not go to the mansion

1104
01:28:05,926 --> 01:28:09,568
I'm sorry.. I'm Nasik

1105
01:28:10,690 --> 01:28:11,976
Shall we go somewhere else?

1106
01:28:13,592 --> 01:28:15,147
Sure.. let's go

1107
01:28:21,982 --> 01:28:23,291
Namaskar

1108
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:28,039
You all helped us a lot during our difficult time

1109
01:28:28,274 --> 01:28:32,083
We were taken care of.. today when we have a good time

1110
01:28:32,341 --> 01:28:34,794
How can we forget you?

1111
01:28:35,288 --> 01:28:36,835
So that's why today..

1112
01:28:37,346 --> 01:28:40,994
A feast from our side for the whole village

1113
01:28:41,932 --> 01:28:43,082
enjoy

1114
01:28:45,275 --> 01:28:46,029
Grandfather

1115
01:28:47,517 --> 01:28:49,184
Money is so little

1116
01:28:49,321 --> 01:28:52,853
Then you will donate.. Where did you get so many chickens?

1117
01:28:52,878 --> 01:28:53,505
shut up

1118
01:28:53,887 --> 01:28:55,506
Not chickens

1119
01:28:55,875 --> 01:28:57,621
crow
- Crow?

1120
01:29:00,117 --> 01:29:02,800
How many crows died last night?

1121
01:29:03,276 --> 01:29:05,665
They are entertained
- A crow treat?

1122
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:06,876
shut up

1123
01:29:15,006 --> 01:29:17,800
Please, little sister, get a doll

1124
01:29:18,549 --> 01:29:20,470
Mallika Nona.. Mandira Nona

1125
01:29:26,946 --> 01:29:29,073
Nice to meet you
- Me too

1126
01:29:29,551 --> 01:29:30,606
come on

1127
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:34,771
Nice to meet you

1128
01:29:35,408 --> 01:29:36,971
Same to me.. Come on

1129
01:29:39,308 --> 01:29:43,017
<i>My dear.. My dear..</i>

01:31:28,855 --> 01:31:34,278
Live in your dreams and die in your love

1151
01:31:34,303 --> 01:31:39,068
<i>My.. My..</i>

1152
01:31:39,093 --> 01:31:43,867
<i>My dear.. My dear..</i>

1153
01:31:43,892 --> 01:31:48,626
<i>Look into my eyes and say what is in your heart..</i>

1154
01:31:48,651 --> 01:31:53,494
<i><font color="

1155
01:31:53,519 --> 01:31:57,862
<i>Hold with your hands.. Don't let go anywhere..</i>

1156
01:32:50,495 --> 01:32:53,225
Party.. What is a party for, my lord?

1157
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:55,759
You solved all the problems in our palace

1158
01:32:55,784 --> 01:32:56,823
thank you

1159
01:32:57,706 --> 01:32:58,928
Grab this quick

1160
01:32:59,525 --> 01:33:00,390
And go

1161
01:33:00,807 --> 01:33:05,283
go?
- Oh, there is the Howda Express at 10.. it will be late

1162
01:33:05,308 --> 01:33:06,985
Pack things.. be angry

1163
01:33:23,314 --> 01:33:24,592
Savitri

1164
01:33:24,895 --> 01:33:27,294
Honoring you with marbles..

1165
01:33:27,571 --> 01:33:29,706
Making a very large sculpture

1166
01:33:29,731 --> 01:33:31,725
Talking to aliens?

1167
01:33:32,308 --> 01:33:36,434
No.. with mother
Emotional

1168
01:33:42,731 --> 01:33:44,151
I'm not with him

1169
01:33:46,369 --> 01:33:47,155
what

1170
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:48,601
What nonsense?

1171
01:33:56,389 --> 01:33:58,175
Are you talking to me like that now?

1172
01:33:59,496 --> 01:34:00,671
your heart

1173
01:34:01,268 --> 01:34:02,443
Injured

1174
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:04,602
hey

1175
01:34:09,299 --> 01:34:11,958
Because your love is dead like mine?

1176
01:34:21,201 --> 01:34:24,193
King.. I forgot to tell you something

1177
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,538
Not only can I talk to the soul

1178
01:34:26,603 --> 01:34:28,468
Spirits come and lodge inside me

1179
01:34:29,064 --> 01:34:30,866
Don't jump in and talk

1180
01:34:32,110 --> 01:34:34,658
Aunty Ji I am just..
- Shut up

1181
01:34:34,683 --> 01:34:36,572
I am talking to my husband

1182
01:34:36,597 --> 01:34:38,081
Don't get in the middle of it

1183
01:34:38,106 --> 01:34:40,154
Do you take your medicine every day?

1184
01:34:40,179 --> 01:34:41,386
Savitri

1185
01:34:41,411 --> 01:34:43,570
Yes Savitri
- Mom?

1186
01:34:46,592 --> 01:34:47,521
alive

1187
01:34:47,910 --> 01:34:49,172
what did you say

1188
01:34:49,404 --> 01:34:51,388
Making a marble sculpture of me?

1189
01:34:51,413 --> 01:34:54,001
Because the whole life of keeping me as a fake woman is over

1190
01:34:54,025 --> 01:34:55,296
Savitri
- Drop it

1191
01:34:55,463 --> 01:34:57,426
I don't want any sculpture

1192
01:34:57,552 --> 01:35:00,037
I just want a boy

1193
01:35:00,062 --> 01:35:02,340
a boy
- A boy?

1194
01:35:03,176 --> 01:35:04,559
For my daughter

1195
01:35:06,156 --> 01:35:07,831
Every mother has a dream

1196
01:35:08,016 --> 01:35:10,468
His daughter will one day be someone else's

1197
01:35:10,915 --> 01:35:12,676
The other I found the boy

1198
01:35:13,219 --> 01:35:13,965
who

1199
01:35:14,507 --> 01:35:16,006
how is he

1200
01:35:17,699 --> 01:35:18,842
mother

1201
01:35:18,867 --> 01:35:20,097
what are you doing

1202
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:23,344
Don't you like him?
- Would like to

1203
01:35:23,369 --> 01:35:26,873
But..
- Then let me talk to my husband

1204
01:35:27,878 --> 01:35:31,656
I have seen this boy from the inside
- From the inside?

1205
01:35:31,967 --> 01:35:33,729
I am inside him

1206
01:35:34,074 --> 01:35:35,336
A diamond alone

1207
01:35:35,583 --> 01:35:37,663
Timu
- Timer

1208
01:35:38,595 --> 01:35:42,071
Mother.. If only you had asked Meera once

1209
01:35:43,061 --> 01:35:45,218
Well said.. Meera

1210
01:35:48,994 --> 01:35:52,589
To tell you the truth.. you love him, don't you?

1211
01:35:53,268 --> 01:35:54,379
Are you getting married?

1212
01:35:55,795 --> 01:35:56,779
yes mom

1213
01:35:57,670 --> 01:35:58,821
Getting married

1214
01:35:59,259 --> 01:36:00,069
ok

1215
01:36:00,634 --> 01:36:03,753
Get ready for the wedding soon

1216
01:36:03,778 --> 01:36:05,798
Thirty two inside..
- Hey, stop

1217
01:36:14,499 --> 01:36:15,769
sister

1218
01:36:16,928 --> 01:36:18,531
is the boy ok

1219
01:36:18,556 --> 01:36:20,963
What can I say sister.. great choice

1220
01:36:21,425 --> 01:36:23,275
good good
- Come on

1221
01:36:29,261 --> 01:36:31,785
Oh.. haven't you cleaned the room yet?

1222
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:36,899
Hurry up, the buyers will come
- Calm down... we cleaned everything

1223
01:36:36,924 --> 01:36:37,852
Everything is clean

1224
01:36:37,877 --> 01:36:40,961
Hey clean up and show madam what you found

1225
01:36:42,754 --> 01:36:45,064
Idiots.. Why are you showing what was stolen?

1226
01:36:45,089 --> 01:36:47,059
I showed that this was stolen

1227
01:36:47,084 --> 01:36:50,136
good good
- Show the main thing

1228
01:36:50,161 --> 01:36:54,041
That means content
- As much as I know English

1229
01:36:54,066 --> 01:36:57,586
According to that.. Rajakumari Manjulika has written

1230
01:37:04,278 --> 01:37:05,715
Open it

1231
01:37:11,817 --> 01:37:15,032
Now Manjulika's secret is revealed

1232
01:37:24,162 --> 01:37:25,257
oh oh oh

1233
01:37:25,586 --> 01:37:29,118
Sorry sorry fell by mistake.. something important?

1234
01:37:34,658 --> 01:37:36,087
The paint fell

1235
01:37:36,287 --> 01:37:39,637
You roll like I lost someone's life?

1236
01:37:43,050 --> 01:37:46,708
Where did you bring me?
- In this room, all the royal clothes are kept

1237
01:37:46,830 --> 01:37:49,251
You pull Devendranath's sherwari

1238
01:37:49,276 --> 01:37:51,181
I am from Moreia

1239
01:37:54,157 --> 01:37:55,292
nonsense

1240
01:37:59,153 --> 01:38:00,367
good

1241
01:38:00,392 --> 01:38:01,535
But it's ridiculous

1242
01:38:05,295 --> 01:38:06,866
Please show me something good

1243
01:38:07,169 --> 01:38:08,168
a good one

1244
01:38:09,609 --> 01:38:11,910
Here is the best one

1245
01:38:12,372 --> 01:38:13,484
This..

1246
01:38:18,618 --> 01:38:20,094
please leave me

1247
01:38:20,119 --> 01:38:22,071
Oh uncle, let go of what is holding you

1248
01:38:22,096 --> 01:38:23,914
Oh, who will leave me?

1249
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:26,654
Please leave me, I will die

1250
01:38:31,059 --> 01:38:35,011
Leave me, save me..

1251
01:38:35,203 --> 01:38:39,088
Please leave.. Please leave uncle
- Save me

1252
01:38:39,113 --> 01:38:42,188
Why are you hitting me?

1253
01:38:42,213 --> 01:38:46,214
Please hit me?
- It's about to give up

1254
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:47,702
let's go

1255
01:38:47,727 --> 01:38:51,060
Run.. Run

1256
01:38:51,921 --> 01:38:53,796
How did the door close?

1257
01:38:55,927 --> 01:38:58,477
Coming here.. What are you doing?

1258
01:38:59,381 --> 01:39:01,685
save me
- Opened

1259
01:39:01,733 --> 01:39:04,801
Run.. Run

1260
01:39:05,557 --> 01:39:07,335
Brother-in-law.. Brother-in-law

1261
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:10,534
what happened
- A demon

1262
01:39:10,608 --> 01:39:12,489
a demon

1263
01:39:25,133 --> 01:39:27,275
How could your husband Ryan even think of this?

1264
01:39:27,729 --> 01:39:30,292
We will sell this palace for so low

1265
01:39:30,326 --> 01:39:34,176
Brother in law.. A demon is a demon

1266
01:39:34,201 --> 01:39:35,932
Yes, that's what I'm saying

1267
01:39:35,957 --> 01:39:39,007
Now there is not even a ghost in this palace
- This is a major property

1268
01:39:39,032 --> 01:39:42,217
It is so little.. only 8000 crores?

1269
01:39:42,242 --> 01:39:43,781
8000 crores?

1270
01:39:43,806 --> 01:39:44,855
did you see

1271
01:39:45,294 --> 01:39:48,215
What happened to the face of the little one.. that much less

1272
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:50,664
Take your letter
- King, you are making a mistake

1273
01:39:50,689 --> 01:39:51,552
Says right

1274
01:39:55,891 --> 01:39:56,748
right?

1275
01:39:56,933 --> 01:39:59,377
Now.. get out

1276
01:39:59,595 --> 01:40:02,122
What have you done?
- This brother

1277
01:40:02,146 --> 01:40:02,745
brother in law

1278
01:40:02,770 --> 01:40:05,225
Manjulika's ghost has not left this palace

1279
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:08,291
He tried to kill me even now.. Look
- What are you saying?

1280
01:40:08,603 --> 01:40:11,032
Is he the one who kicked him out?
- Where did you go?

1281
01:40:11,057 --> 01:40:14,171
He was also afraid of a demon and ran away..
- Yes, this is no Baba

1282
01:40:14,196 --> 01:40:15,682
He is the right king

1283
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:18,580
I have not really had any rebirth

1284
01:40:18,605 --> 01:40:21,560
Do not leave demons and ghosts.. even if a mouse comes

1285
01:40:21,753 --> 01:40:24,364
He goes in his pants from time to time.. King

1286
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:25,953
You don't understand

1287
01:40:26,168 --> 01:40:28,168
King.. where did you go?

1288
01:40:28,957 --> 01:40:30,560
Someone comes with a tape

1289
01:40:31,237 --> 01:40:33,594
King.. it is in pieces

1290
01:40:35,156 --> 01:40:36,823
Pahara, I will tear you to pieces

1291
01:40:37,896 --> 01:40:39,206
father
- Brother-in-law

1292
01:40:39,231 --> 01:40:41,531
Dad..
- Oh, my lord

1293
01:40:41,555 --> 01:40:44,636
Savitri also made a noise.. You are a thief

1294
01:40:44,661 --> 01:40:46,340
Follow me, king

1295
01:40:47,191 --> 01:40:49,714
First think how to escape from Manjulika

1296
01:40:51,953 --> 01:40:54,072
Grandpa.. Grandpa is saying..

1297
01:40:54,288 --> 01:40:56,129
Leave this castle and run away?
- No

1298
01:40:56,584 --> 01:40:58,576
Why.. home
- Fruit

1299
01:40:59,064 --> 01:41:01,937
I can't live on two scraps now, please

1300
01:41:02,693 --> 01:41:04,613
Even if Manjulika ate us..

1301
01:41:05,171 --> 01:41:06,727
But without selling this palace, we..

1302
01:41:07,699 --> 01:41:09,619
Then let's sell it

1303
01:41:09,978 --> 01:41:12,470
Who do you sell to?
- Arya is there

1304
01:41:12,981 --> 01:41:14,560
Rani Sahiba Mandira

1305
01:41:15,222 --> 01:41:17,406
He doesn't know anything about these demonic things

1306
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:20,772
I touched you.. you touch him

1307
01:41:20,797 --> 01:41:22,536
Let's sell this palace to him

1308
01:41:23,922 --> 01:41:26,168
to the skin

1309
01:41:28,881 --> 01:41:29,889
Mrs. Mandira

1310
01:41:30,112 --> 01:41:33,041
Showed you the palace.. took you around the village

1311
01:41:33,217 --> 01:41:35,939
Showed the shopping mall.. How much more time will it take?

1312
01:41:35,964 --> 01:41:39,244
Take the palace and finish it
- I really liked the palace

1313
01:41:39,368 --> 01:41:42,447
That's why I prepared all the documents together with my lawyer

1314
01:41:42,472 --> 01:41:44,823
What are you saying?
- But I am

1315
01:41:44,969 --> 01:41:46,254
1000 crore will be given

1316
01:41:46,279 --> 01:41:48,959
Come on..
- Okay brother

1317
01:41:48,984 --> 01:41:50,776
Oh, it's a little less, let's do something

1318
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,068
We don't even have time
- It's okay

1319
01:41:53,093 --> 01:41:54,381
The palace was yours

1320
01:41:54,406 --> 01:41:57,653
Let's go and pack
- But I have a small condition

1321
01:41:58,250 --> 01:42:01,168
what now
- I will take this palace after two days

1322
01:42:01,193 --> 01:42:04,144
On Durghashtmi day
- Oh... after two days?

1323
01:42:04,169 --> 01:42:08,441
It's getting too late.. No, you should take it now
- It was a very good day

1324
01:42:09,050 --> 01:42:11,312
Sorry..no deal before that

1325
01:42:11,591 --> 01:42:13,496
oh god
- Then the deal

1326
01:42:13,807 --> 01:42:14,727
do it with me

1327
01:42:17,668 --> 01:42:19,819
brother in law
- This is Vicki Kanna

1328
01:42:20,093 --> 01:42:22,800
Yes..a very big businessman

1329
01:42:22,825 --> 01:42:23,782
He is a very big man

1330
01:42:23,826 --> 01:42:26,453
Do you know how to greet?
- pee?

1331
01:42:27,012 --> 01:42:29,933
Then you make an offer
- Your Majesty

1332
01:42:30,273 --> 01:42:32,416
I love this property

1333
01:42:32,441 --> 01:42:35,068
So I trust you to pay dearly

1334
01:42:35,093 --> 01:42:38,627
Very much..
- 1000 crores will be given

1335
01:42:38,652 --> 01:42:39,750
I will give it now

1336
01:42:40,228 --> 01:42:41,085
do you give

1337
01:42:41,428 --> 01:42:43,198
He does the deal in two days

1338
01:42:43,223 --> 01:42:44,648
i will do it today
- What are you saying?

1339
01:42:44,672 --> 01:42:49,766
Please come then.. come inside

1340
01:43:06,170 --> 01:43:09,162
Wow.. what a great looking chair?

1341
01:43:09,481 --> 01:43:10,521
A great design

1342
01:43:11,118 --> 01:43:13,324
I love it
- This is valuable

1343
01:43:14,502 --> 01:43:17,542
This was the king's throne

1344
01:43:17,847 --> 01:43:23,652
Load the rest of the things into my car.. and I think it will be beautiful..

1345
01:43:24,083 --> 01:43:24,972
at home

1346
01:43:25,792 --> 01:43:27,959
This throne is a symbol of this palace

1347
01:43:28,883 --> 01:43:30,550
It is part of heritage

1348
01:43:30,575 --> 01:43:32,885
Madam.. I will take the palace

1349
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:36,079
And everything here is mine.. I will do anything

1350
01:43:36,104 --> 01:43:37,866
The other.. who is he?

1351
01:43:37,891 --> 01:43:39,281
This is Mallika sir..

1352
01:43:39,306 --> 01:43:42,158
This palace is being restored

1353
01:43:42,564 --> 01:43:46,485
Now you don't need anything.. because I have this palace

1354
01:43:46,510 --> 01:43:51,046
Don't want to restore.. I want to design it again

1355
01:43:51,812 --> 01:43:55,042
And this is not the king's palace

1356
01:43:55,498 --> 01:43:57,863
There is my bar

1357
01:44:08,895 --> 01:44:09,982
bye

1358
01:44:10,818 --> 01:44:14,905
Please take it slowly.. take it carefully
- Then, Your Majesty

1359
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:16,750
I will say goodbye to you

1360
01:44:19,089 --> 01:44:22,987
This palace is mine from tomorrow..
- Pranam

1361
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:13,238
Mallika

1362
01:46:14,670 --> 01:46:18,004
Mallika how did this throne come back here?

1363
01:46:19,883 --> 01:46:20,851
Mallika

1364
01:46:21,074 --> 01:46:22,947
I ask you something

1365
01:46:25,125 --> 01:46:28,412
And why are you sitting there?
- Kutawahapiya Para Balli

1366
01:46:30,113 --> 01:46:31,748
Shakchuni

1367
01:46:32,330 --> 01:46:33,719
Brainless wolves

1368
01:46:34,858 --> 01:46:37,286
Did you give him my throne?

1369
01:46:37,622 --> 01:46:39,686
Where did you get the strength?

1370
01:46:40,236 --> 01:46:42,728
How many times will it be taken away from me?

1371
01:46:43,358 --> 01:46:45,652
This is my throne

1372
01:46:45,852 --> 01:46:47,807
This is my throne

1373
01:46:51,042 --> 01:46:53,757
And if someone tries to touch it..

1374
01:46:53,782 --> 01:46:58,077
I will tear them to pieces and drink their blood

1375
01:46:58,739 --> 01:47:01,683
This is my throne

1376
01:47:01,916 --> 01:47:04,441
Dad.. Dad

1377
01:47:07,024 --> 01:47:10,931
Mallika.. inside..
- Say yes Mira

1378
01:47:12,555 --> 01:47:16,564
You are here?.. but your hand..
- Where?

1379
01:47:16,851 --> 01:47:17,883
I am here

1380
01:47:20,031 --> 01:47:23,197
Meera listen to me.. you know he is dead

1381
01:47:23,868 --> 01:47:27,543
who
- Vicky is dead

1382
01:47:38,058 --> 01:47:39,066
dead

1383
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:42,960
I'm sorry

1384
01:47:43,548 --> 01:47:44,793
It's very harsh

1385
01:47:46,066 --> 01:47:50,005
Take it here.. it's dead

1386
01:47:51,754 --> 01:47:56,606
I thought he couldn't take your palace

1387
01:47:58,072 --> 01:48:01,081
So I will sign it two or three times

1388
01:48:01,327 --> 01:48:02,820
On Durghashtmi day

1389
01:48:05,118 --> 01:48:06,586
dead

1390
01:48:08,042 --> 01:48:09,510
dead

1391
01:48:15,223 --> 01:48:17,517
Who laughs at the news of someone's death?

1392
01:48:19,594 --> 01:48:21,411
This seems strange to me

1393
01:48:24,701 --> 01:48:27,091
I feel a little weird too

1394
01:48:27,872 --> 01:48:29,554
I want to show the doctor

1395
01:48:30,296 --> 01:48:33,312
Ever since he arrived, something has been strange

1396
01:48:34,394 --> 01:48:35,633
I think the same

1397
01:48:37,677 --> 01:48:39,820
I doubt it..
- She is also called Manjulika

1398
01:48:41,322 --> 01:48:41,862
yes

1399
01:48:42,968 --> 01:48:45,794
Do you remember how you freaked out when you told the story of going to the mansion?

1400
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,971
I don't believe in God

1401
01:48:47,996 --> 01:48:50,631
But the deal in the palace is also done on Durghashtmi day

1402
01:48:50,809 --> 01:48:52,206
Who are you talking about?

1403
01:48:52,636 --> 01:48:53,453
About mansions

1404
01:48:53,947 --> 01:48:56,241
Oh, I'm talking about Mallika

1405
01:48:56,266 --> 01:48:58,601
Oh, why do you doubt that helplessly?

1406
01:48:58,626 --> 01:49:01,015
He calls me his own brother
- That's it

1407
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:02,636
How much more big hint will he give?

1408
01:49:03,021 --> 01:49:08,094
You don't know how angry he was looking at Vicky Kanna that day.. He talked to take the throne.

1409
01:49:08,119 --> 01:49:10,748
Oh man, Mandira was the one who was shaking in anger that day

1410
01:49:10,773 --> 01:49:13,108
When he took the deal in his palace from him

1411
01:49:13,133 --> 01:49:17,357
You don't even believe the story of me lifting the throne?
- Oh, how do you believe?

1412
01:49:17,382 --> 01:49:19,988
Mallika was with me then
- Don't believe it

1413
01:49:20,013 --> 01:49:21,712
But Mallika is Manjulika

1414
01:49:22,833 --> 01:49:23,936
I say

1415
01:49:25,267 --> 01:49:26,386
Mandira is Manjulika

1416
01:51:35,389 --> 01:51:36,723
what happened

1417
01:51:38,542 --> 01:51:40,558
This is what you think

1418
01:51:40,863 --> 01:51:45,656
Which of the two of us is Manjulika?

1419
01:51:46,761 --> 01:51:48,626
I am Manjulika

1420
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:50,968
I am Manjulika

1421
01:51:51,232 --> 01:51:54,209
I am Manjulika

1422
01:51:54,234 --> 01:51:56,640
I am Manjulika

1423
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:02,450
survived

1424
01:52:51,559 --> 01:52:52,607
There.. there

1425
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:34,504
Forgive me God.. from today all wrong work will stop

1426
01:53:34,534 --> 01:53:36,229
Dad took her on a date for money

1427
01:53:37,201 --> 01:53:44,138
Again, I do not do demonic things

1428
01:53:44,163 --> 01:53:45,598
Where did I come?

1429
01:53:46,576 --> 01:53:48,234
Again, I do not do demonic things

1430
01:53:51,073 --> 01:53:54,994
Pandit.. The mall in this palace has become very dangerous

1431
01:53:55,169 --> 01:53:55,796
what happened

1432
01:53:55,974 --> 01:53:58,411
I saw a vampire on the roof yesterday

1433
01:53:58,436 --> 01:54:00,064
hey seriously

1434
01:54:00,089 --> 01:54:02,571
The cloth was opened
- That's me

1435
01:54:02,596 --> 01:54:06,234
Oh, how many times have you told me not to do that with long hair?

1436
01:54:06,912 --> 01:54:08,687
There are no demons, ghosts or ghouls

1437
01:54:09,042 --> 01:54:10,026
That's how it is

1438
01:54:10,051 --> 01:54:12,503
If Manjulika was there, I would be like that..

1439
01:54:12,528 --> 01:54:14,743
Humiliate him by telling him to embrace him

1440
01:54:14,897 --> 01:54:17,937
Will not be fine
- So how did Vicki Kanna die?

1441
01:54:18,073 --> 01:54:19,205
Nonsense

1442
01:54:19,448 --> 01:54:20,872
Where did Vicki Kanna die?

1443
01:54:22,961 --> 01:54:25,406
Athana is sitting on the settee in front of her.. Athana

1444
01:54:29,166 --> 01:54:32,929
Oh God.. talking about you

1445
01:54:32,954 --> 01:54:36,306
Where have you been?
- Serve sir

1446
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:39,753
And when you sit on the throne

1447
01:54:39,778 --> 01:54:42,146
The three of us will take care of everything for you, sir

1448
01:54:42,171 --> 01:54:43,947
I will serve like that

1449
01:54:43,972 --> 01:54:47,910
The way you won't be found even in heaven after death
- Yes, nowhere else

1450
01:54:47,935 --> 01:54:50,730
Stretch your arms a little and throw 20 to 25 lakhs on your face

1451
01:54:50,754 --> 01:54:54,575
If you serve like this, you will definitely be beaten.

1452
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:56,388
right sir

1453
01:54:56,717 --> 01:54:58,098
Do you know little Pandit?

1454
01:54:58,495 --> 01:55:00,693
Big men's hands

1455
01:55:00,718 --> 01:55:02,959
Much longer than the law

1456
01:55:03,127 --> 01:55:05,461
Doesn't this arm look too long?

1457
01:55:08,323 --> 01:55:10,831
Here the tension around the neck has increased

1458
01:55:10,953 --> 01:55:13,056
Would you mind giving me a little massage?

1459
01:55:26,017 --> 01:55:29,374
Gentlemen.. did you sit facing the other side?

1460
01:55:37,156 --> 01:55:39,211
oh god

1461
01:55:43,549 --> 01:55:44,550
Vicky G

1462
01:55:44,575 --> 01:55:47,710
You were a very good person

1463
01:55:47,735 --> 01:55:50,723
But we are the king's servants, right?

1464
01:55:50,748 --> 01:55:55,905
You only get to eat once in two days.. but do you even know if there is salt or not?

1465
01:55:55,930 --> 01:55:58,501
And we cannot do the work that serves us, sir

1466
01:55:58,743 --> 01:56:00,997
Goodbye.. Nice to meet you..

1467
01:56:01,371 --> 01:56:05,842
Hey hey leaving
- A demonic spirit

1468
01:56:05,867 --> 01:56:07,652
Hey leaving

1469
01:56:08,029 --> 01:56:10,600
leaving

1470
01:56:21,997 --> 01:56:25,393
Talking to avoid

1471
01:56:27,272 --> 01:56:29,014
No, no, sister

1472
01:56:29,038 --> 01:56:31,662
No no..
- Let's escape

1473
01:56:37,884 --> 01:56:39,719
What does Netflix turn on?

1474
01:56:54,142 --> 01:56:55,817
Sings a Bengali song

1475
01:57:00,617 --> 01:57:04,516
Listen.. did you sleep in my room last night?

1476
01:57:05,391 --> 01:57:06,137
No so?

1477
01:57:09,435 --> 01:57:13,946
No .. you got up and laughed then fell asleep

1478
01:57:14,907 --> 01:57:16,606
Did you laugh?

1479
01:57:19,875 --> 01:57:20,676
Is that so?

1480
01:57:23,170 --> 01:57:26,731
I will come.. he said not

1481
01:57:26,756 --> 01:57:30,525
He didn't accept.. I came suspecting him

1482
01:57:35,629 --> 01:57:37,312
Ghostbusters
- Take us out

1483
01:57:40,729 --> 01:57:43,229
please listen
- Take us out

1484
01:57:46,155 --> 01:57:49,107
Death has come here.. Their songs will never end

1485
01:57:49,206 --> 01:57:51,420
Dance, you thieves.. I'm going

1486
01:57:54,241 --> 01:57:56,059
Ruhan.. where are you going?

1487
01:57:57,116 --> 01:57:59,227
What happened? Why don't you say anything?

1488
01:57:59,849 --> 01:58:02,944
Oh, Ruhan, our marriage is going to happen

1489
01:58:03,558 --> 01:58:05,153
You... come up

1490
01:58:06,291 --> 01:58:07,259
the fruit

1491
01:58:10,519 --> 01:58:11,210
father

1492
01:58:12,155 --> 01:58:14,243
Father Ruhan left us all

1493
01:58:14,976 --> 01:58:17,913
Good job.. Good job

1494
01:58:17,938 --> 01:58:20,924
At least Manjulika did a good job by killing him

1495
01:58:21,023 --> 01:58:23,897
Oh, not dead.. He left the palace

1496
01:58:24,423 --> 01:58:28,050
It's very good for you.. I didn't like that boy at all from the beginning

1497
01:58:28,075 --> 01:58:31,189
Is there someone.. someone who is going to die.. someone who is going to die

1498
01:58:31,422 --> 01:58:32,358
What are you looking at?

1499
01:58:32,773 --> 01:58:35,241
If he dies, you will be guilty.. Pick it up and put it inside

1500
01:58:35,568 --> 01:58:36,409
please

1501
01:58:38,944 --> 01:58:40,121
What happened brother?

1502
01:58:40,512 --> 01:58:42,607
Oh, nothing.. I wanted to say

1503
01:59:07,310 --> 01:59:08,628
you..

1504
01:59:13,182 --> 01:59:14,801
What's going on?

1505
01:59:27,156 --> 01:59:30,649
Oh bro, who are you waiting for? Why don't you leave here?

1506
01:59:30,803 --> 01:59:33,057
Can't get out of this maze

1507
01:59:33,082 --> 01:59:35,296
Can't go.. Can't go

1508
01:59:43,768 --> 01:59:48,500
Hey escape little Pandit.. Death is also seen in your horoscope today

1509
01:59:51,992 --> 01:59:52,524
you

1510
01:59:55,478 --> 01:59:57,999
You left, didn't you?
- Can't go

1511
01:59:58,910 --> 01:59:59,895
can't go

1512
02:00:00,602 --> 02:00:01,571
leave you

1513
02:00:02,724 --> 02:00:04,676
Leave all of you

1514
02:00:04,701 --> 02:00:08,974
Now all of you are my family

1515
02:00:09,042 --> 02:00:12,447
When it's yours
- Our daughter has found a hero type boy

1516
02:00:12,733 --> 02:00:13,487
look

1517
02:00:16,748 --> 02:00:18,963
Let's eat
- Yes, let's go

1518
02:00:19,122 --> 02:00:21,241


1519
02:00:21,283 --> 02:00:22,689
shut up

1520
02:00:23,667 --> 02:00:25,659
Meera.. don't talk to me

1521
02:00:25,684 --> 02:00:28,853
With whom?
- Do with me.. Why did you come back here?

1522
02:00:28,878 --> 02:00:30,832
No one is saved here

1523
02:00:30,857 --> 02:00:33,643
Anyone becomes Manjulika.. we go

1524
02:00:33,668 --> 02:00:34,811
Can you go?

1525
02:00:34,836 --> 02:00:38,981
Because God has given you legs that you can't walk
- We also have our Rolls Royce

1526
02:00:39,006 --> 02:00:40,048
let's escape
- Good

1527
02:00:40,334 --> 02:00:41,321
See you in a while

1528
02:00:42,433 --> 02:00:44,338
What are these thieves doing? Let's go

1529
02:00:44,419 --> 02:00:45,832
Put this on

1530
02:00:46,342 --> 02:00:47,730
What are these.. Why?

1531
02:00:47,755 --> 02:00:50,039
Oh, Manjulika's gaze has fallen on us

1532
02:00:50,063 --> 02:00:52,607
If you wear these, you won't be able to catch them.. Cover your face

1533
02:00:52,632 --> 02:00:54,389
Can't see anything

1534
02:00:54,414 --> 02:00:55,628
Cover completely

1535
02:00:55,853 --> 02:00:57,662
Did you check everything?

1536
02:01:09,117 --> 02:01:10,684
He came back to where he was

1537
02:01:10,709 --> 02:01:13,400
Why did you bring it back to where you were, idiots?

1538
02:01:13,425 --> 02:01:14,990
I didn't bring it

1539
02:01:15,326 --> 02:01:18,398
Leave it..
- Rolls Royce

1540
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:27,250
Oops

1541
02:01:27,275 --> 02:01:29,546
The vehicle split into two pieces

1542
02:01:31,898 --> 02:01:34,295
Take off the glasses

1543
02:01:50,521 --> 02:01:52,872
the hair

1544
02:01:52,897 --> 02:01:56,017
It is said that there is death in your horoscope today

1545
02:01:56,042 --> 02:02:02,746
The thief was killed
- Save, Mother Durga

1546
02:02:07,381 --> 02:02:08,873
This is the pure oil

1547
02:02:09,899 --> 02:02:11,978
With these you will finish the manjulika

1548
02:02:12,368 --> 02:02:13,622
But who is he?

1549
02:02:13,855 --> 02:02:16,061
Not the rebirth of the prince

1550
02:02:16,548 --> 02:02:18,222
Do you know what to do in the city?

1551
02:02:18,415 --> 02:02:21,661
They are deceiving people by pretending to drive out Bhutayon

1552
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:23,125
do you know

1553
02:02:23,405 --> 02:02:25,539
I knew his truth on the first day

1554
02:02:25,859 --> 02:02:27,327
And I know this too

1555
02:02:27,352 --> 02:02:30,297
That the prophecies of my ancestors can never be wrong

1556
02:02:30,681 --> 02:02:33,586
Well, let's accept that I am the reincarnation of the prince

1557
02:02:33,702 --> 02:02:34,916
But who will put the oil?

1558
02:02:35,172 --> 02:02:36,617
Mandira or Mallika?

1559
02:02:36,642 --> 02:02:38,133
what
- Does that mean?

1560
02:02:38,158 --> 02:02:41,237
Do you think either of them is Manjulika?

1561
02:02:41,313 --> 02:02:44,901
Strange things have been happening since those two came here

1562
02:02:45,197 --> 02:02:49,856
Folard Singh.. You must have lived for such a long time with Manjulika in your lap.

1563
02:02:49,881 --> 02:02:55,365
Tell me who is Manjulika
- It's a very old incident, I don't remember Panditji

1564
02:02:55,390 --> 02:02:58,504
I will say.. I found the picture of Manjulika

1565
02:02:58,529 --> 02:03:01,952
Your younger brother dropped the ink on it

1566
02:03:01,977 --> 02:03:04,209
I sent it to the city to be cleaned

1567
02:03:04,234 --> 02:03:08,125
The crazy girl could have given us all of us doing the work beautifully

1568
02:03:08,150 --> 02:03:12,352
Oh, silly pumpkin, the ink is not cleaned with soap, but with a special chemical

1569
02:03:14,009 --> 02:03:15,374
Only one day left

1570
02:03:16,526 --> 02:03:18,907
Everything will be known tomorrow
- Tomorrow?

1571
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:22,343
That means Durghashtmi day

1572
02:03:30,987 --> 02:03:34,281
Oh, we can only chase away false demons by pulling Baba's clothes

1573
02:03:34,306 --> 02:03:37,134
Manjulika is a vampire
- You don't understand

1574
02:03:38,257 --> 02:03:39,535
There is the oil

1575
02:03:40,299 --> 02:03:44,878
Then only oil can save us
- Please go and find out whether the picture has been cleaned or not

1576
02:03:59,008 --> 02:04:03,360
What are you two doing?
- Ghostbusters

1577
02:04:03,385 --> 02:04:07,032
I have had lice since childhood

1578
02:04:07,057 --> 02:04:09,581
The lice died, the mother died.. but the lice did not die

1579
02:04:09,606 --> 02:04:12,861
What oil did you use, sister?
- Kana Baba's Ayurvedic Oil

1580
02:04:13,118 --> 02:04:15,404
The company closed but the lice did not die

1581
02:04:15,765 --> 02:04:20,058
So we thought that if the demons were killed by this oil, our lice would also be killed

1582
02:04:20,294 --> 02:04:23,473
Does pure oil kill lice?
- Lucky you

1583
02:04:23,497 --> 02:04:26,226
No hair
- The hair?

1584
02:04:26,251 --> 02:04:28,797
Oh, that hair.. Podi Pandit

1585
02:04:28,821 --> 02:04:31,703
Or your hair will run out of oil

1586
02:04:33,450 --> 02:04:37,148
I will finish you both
- What are you doing? Oh, what kind of donkey are you?

1587
02:04:37,173 --> 02:04:39,325
Are you trying to beat yourself up with your own sandal?

1588
02:04:39,350 --> 02:04:44,298
Manjulika.. Manjulika
- Cheating rogue

1589
02:05:04,460 --> 02:05:05,714
Meera.. Meera

1590
02:05:10,007 --> 02:05:11,126
What are you doing Meera?

1591
02:05:11,977 --> 02:05:16,145
I had a very bad dream

1592
02:05:17,332 --> 02:05:18,705
I noticed

1593
02:05:19,804 --> 02:05:23,415
I burn myself alive

1594
02:05:24,728 --> 02:05:25,474
what

1595
02:05:35,622 --> 02:05:36,471
Meera

1596
02:05:38,093 --> 02:05:39,261
Give me the lighter

1597
02:05:41,795 --> 02:05:44,184
You were just as scared

1598
02:05:46,219 --> 02:05:49,212
Meera.. if anything happens to you

1599
02:05:49,365 --> 02:05:51,032
Then let's die together

1600
02:05:54,063 --> 02:05:54,793
yes

1601
02:05:56,025 --> 02:05:57,017
Let's burn together

1602
02:05:57,826 --> 02:05:58,683
I'm coming

1603
02:06:00,886 --> 02:06:01,759
I'm coming

1604
02:06:02,815 --> 02:06:03,633
come on

1605
02:06:04,836 --> 02:06:06,463
coming

1606
02:06:08,069 --> 02:06:14,309
Meera.. Meera
- Giving up.. Giving up

1607
02:06:22,538 --> 02:06:23,982
what happened to you

1608
02:06:24,874 --> 02:06:27,660
I.. I..

1609
02:06:27,685 --> 02:06:29,446
Was sitting with Mandira

1610
02:06:29,471 --> 02:06:31,164
i..

1611
02:06:34,408 --> 02:06:35,463
Mansions

1612
02:06:36,092 --> 02:06:37,020
Ruhan

1613
02:06:37,187 --> 02:06:38,115
Mansions

1614
02:06:38,140 --> 02:06:39,173
Ruhan

1615
02:06:56,009 --> 02:06:57,128
Mansions

1616
02:06:57,860 --> 02:06:59,812
Ruhan
- What's the problem?

1617
02:07:00,656 --> 02:07:02,703
What happened Ruhan?
- You have a fight with me

1618
02:07:03,014 --> 02:07:04,102
Why was Mira taken in the middle?

1619
02:07:04,573 --> 02:07:05,557
Meera

1620
02:07:07,201 --> 02:07:09,792
I didn't understand anything
- Stop this nadagama of yours

1621
02:07:10,413 --> 02:07:12,587
Were you waiting for Durghashtmee?

1622
02:07:12,612 --> 02:07:17,663
Today is Durghashtmee.. Either you finish me or I will finish you

1623
02:07:17,688 --> 02:07:22,006
Where.. start.. start
- What are you doing, are you crazy?

1624
02:07:22,030 --> 02:07:22,476
Ruhan

1625
02:07:22,501 --> 02:07:23,713
Don't get in the middle

1626
02:07:23,738 --> 02:07:27,766
Ruhan.. is taking
- The picture is clean

1627
02:07:52,010 --> 02:07:57,488
I am Manjulika

1628
02:08:00,955 --> 02:08:04,019
leaving me
- Give up?

1629
02:08:04,044 --> 02:08:06,158
Here.. gave up

1630
02:08:12,118 --> 02:08:16,126
I will kill my beloved brother first.. then you

1631
02:08:21,787 --> 02:08:24,574
What are you looking at my dear brother?

1632
02:08:24,599 --> 02:08:27,933
I'm coming.. I'm coming

1633
02:08:37,431 --> 02:08:40,010
my treasure

1634
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,289
does it hurt

1635
02:08:42,744 --> 02:08:46,331
Here.. I will end your pain
- Ruhan

1636
02:08:47,830 --> 02:08:51,870
I'm going to kill you

1637
02:09:26,209 --> 02:09:28,153
are you ok
- Yes

1638
02:09:29,045 --> 02:09:29,846
please

1639
02:09:30,261 --> 02:09:32,158
Mrs. Mandira.. I'm sorry

1640
02:09:32,183 --> 02:09:34,477
I thought wrong about you.. are you ok?

1641
02:09:44,068 --> 02:09:46,449
I am very well now

1642
02:10:00,356 --> 02:10:02,856
You burned the wrong sister

1643
02:10:03,089 --> 02:10:04,224
save

1644
02:10:04,677 --> 02:10:06,566
I am Manjulika

1645
02:10:06,591 --> 02:10:08,591
I am Manjulika

1646
02:10:24,486 --> 02:10:26,724
This is my throne

1647
02:10:26,749 --> 02:10:28,185
my

1648
02:10:32,429 --> 02:10:34,358
save

1649
02:10:35,250 --> 02:10:37,901
This is how I shouted

1650
02:10:37,926 --> 02:10:42,730
And everyone was standing and watching Nadagama.. You are the ones who are shouting today

1651
02:10:43,290 --> 02:10:45,417
And I watch Nadagama

1652
02:10:45,442 --> 02:10:49,849
Manjulika.. with what strength can you be so arrogant?

1653
02:10:50,234 --> 02:10:52,027
Today is your end

1654
02:10:56,740 --> 02:10:57,963
Raja Purohita

1655
02:10:57,988 --> 02:10:59,194
did you see

1656
02:11:00,111 --> 02:11:04,364
Why is he turning to us now?

1657
02:11:05,648 --> 02:11:08,473
Paharayo gives his full attention to our family

1658
02:11:08,498 --> 02:11:10,095
do something

1659
02:11:12,257 --> 02:11:13,328
Miss Manjulika

1660
02:11:13,353 --> 02:11:18,617
Don't come near us.. Look at the sacred oil in our hair

1661
02:11:20,993 --> 02:11:22,826
You ask this Ghostbuster

1662
02:11:22,851 --> 02:11:24,464
He is the one who gave us the oil.. Tell me

1663
02:11:24,489 --> 02:11:27,586
I didn't give it. You two stole the oil.. Thieves

1664
02:11:36,249 --> 02:11:39,090
Pholard Singh.. protect us

1665
02:11:39,115 --> 02:11:41,562
Run away, who will protect me?

1666
02:11:41,913 --> 02:11:45,764
Oh Baba... Oh Baba

1667
02:11:47,959 --> 02:11:51,419
God protect us all

1668
02:12:14,591 --> 02:12:16,210
Chauhan
- Bang

1669
02:12:16,990 --> 02:12:18,490
Not Chauhan

1670
02:12:18,515 --> 02:12:19,579
Jawan (soldier)

1671
02:12:22,136 --> 02:12:26,630
the soldier
- Soldier?

1672
02:12:36,002 --> 02:12:39,391
Jawan ji took a big jump.. now you too can save us

1673
02:12:45,068 --> 02:12:47,362
Nadkin Paharaya.. How is he a soldier?

1674
02:12:47,387 --> 02:12:50,157
Can't get up even with help

1675
02:12:54,061 --> 02:12:55,157
the hair

1676
02:12:55,182 --> 02:12:58,036
Oh, this is not our thief Konda.. Podi Pandit

1677
02:12:58,061 --> 02:12:59,690
what are you saying

1678
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:06,652
Podi Pandit too
- Podi Pandit.. What Podi Pandit?

1679
02:13:06,677 --> 02:13:09,512
Oh, his memory is gone
- Memory?

1680
02:13:09,537 --> 02:13:10,627
what is that

1681
02:13:13,367 --> 02:13:14,645
He takes the memory

1682
02:13:15,622 --> 02:13:17,892
Mallika G.. Mallika G

1683
02:13:19,017 --> 02:13:20,365
Do you remember?

1684
02:13:46,944 --> 02:13:47,833
Ruhan

1685
02:13:51,161 --> 02:13:52,510
I made a mistake

1686
02:13:52,998 --> 02:13:54,514
Don't do it to him

1687
02:13:58,328 --> 02:14:00,923
The secret I never knew my whole life

1688
02:14:01,226 --> 02:14:02,909
Faced with death

1689
02:14:02,934 --> 02:14:04,721
I remembered it in a moment

1690
02:14:13,901 --> 02:14:15,662
It's true

1691
02:14:16,569 --> 02:14:18,894
I am not a demon and he is not a demon

1692
02:14:22,345 --> 02:14:23,715
The time has come

1693
02:14:24,782 --> 02:14:28,524
Come forward and show your truth

1694
02:15:50,383 --> 02:15:51,613
Manjulica

1695
02:15:53,005 --> 02:15:54,212
Not Manjulika

1696
02:15:55,564 --> 02:15:57,659
Raja Kumar Devendranath

1697
02:16:58,528 --> 02:16:59,610
Debu

1698
02:17:00,284 --> 02:17:02,599
Do you dance night after night in the palace?

1699
02:17:04,262 --> 02:17:06,635
No, sister.. Oh, no

1700
02:17:07,504 --> 02:17:08,877
Why lie?

1701
02:17:09,235 --> 02:17:10,553
We saw you

1702
02:17:11,713 --> 02:17:13,237
Oh, why are you afraid?

1703
02:17:13,462 --> 02:17:15,343
We won't tell anyone

1704
02:17:15,997 --> 02:17:18,362
And we are your sisters

1705
02:17:24,150 --> 02:17:25,149
yes sister

1706
02:17:25,689 --> 02:17:26,864
I dance too

1707
02:17:28,940 --> 02:17:32,106
Our Debu dances so beautifully, isn't it?

1708
02:17:32,538 --> 02:17:34,181
beautiful

1709
02:17:35,057 --> 02:17:36,676
I like to dance very much

1710
02:17:37,704 --> 02:17:39,641
I love art

1711
02:17:40,046 --> 02:17:41,800
I don't want to be a king

1712
02:17:42,683 --> 02:17:46,032
To be honest, I am lonely inside

1713
02:17:46,425 --> 02:17:47,489
Like you guys

1714
02:17:48,213 --> 02:17:49,887
I am not Devendranath

1715
02:17:50,811 --> 02:17:52,049
I am Manjulika

1716
02:17:53,352 --> 02:17:56,440
Well then.. today we will decorate you

1717
02:17:56,770 --> 02:17:59,611
You dance.. then we sing

1718
02:18:00,370 --> 02:18:04,544
<i>Ask my dear..</i>

1719
02:18:04,569 --> 02:18:08,739
<i>The melody of my love..</i>

1720
02:18:08,764 --> 02:18:12,720
<i>Ask my dear..</i>

1721
02:18:12,745 --> 02:18:17,005
<i><font color="

1722
02:18:17,030 --> 02:18:21,222
<i>flows through the atmosphere..</i>

1723
02:18:21,247 --> 02:18:24,734
You gave him the throne because God was a man

1724
02:18:24,759 --> 02:18:26,641
Go and see how low he is

1725
02:18:38,807 --> 02:18:47,085
<i>Innocently.. simply.. I was childish..</i>

1726
02:18:47,110 --> 02:18:51,865
<i>About the cunning tricks of the people of the world..</i>

1727
02:18:51,890 --> 02:18:55,342
<i>I didn't know..</i>

1728
02:18:55,367 --> 02:18:59,663
<i>So injured my innocent heart..</i>

1729
02:18:59,688 --> 02:19:03,617
<i><font color="

1730
02:19:03,642 --> 02:19:07,766
<i>These ties that have fallen from the string are the pearls..</i>

1731
02:19:07,791 --> 02:19:12,252
<i>After being lost, it will not be reunited..</i>

1732
02:19:12,277 --> 02:19:21,119
<i>My own loved ones have betrayed me in poisonous dreams..</i>

1733
02:19:21,521 --> 02:19:24,934
Your Majesty.. What is the punishment to be given to him?

1734
02:19:29,863 --> 02:19:31,054
Death penalty

1735
02:19:31,611 --> 02:19:33,246
But what do you say to the people?

1736
02:19:33,271 --> 02:19:37,526
Announce to the whole kingdom that Rajakumara Devendranath has been killed

1737
02:19:37,767 --> 02:19:39,093
And his murder

1738
02:19:40,985 --> 02:19:42,707
That Manjulika did it

1739
02:19:43,233 --> 02:19:44,058
me

1740
02:19:44,990 --> 02:19:48,117
You two could have told this story even if I was alone

1741
02:19:49,733 --> 02:19:54,727
But you played this song in front of everyone for the sake of the throne

1742
02:19:54,752 --> 02:19:57,603
He danced that low dance for his brother

1743
02:19:58,337 --> 02:20:00,456
No son or daughter of mine

1744
02:20:00,951 --> 02:20:03,221
Not fit for this throne

1745
02:20:05,186 --> 02:20:06,638
From today you

1746
02:20:06,866 --> 02:20:09,770
He is known as the murderer of his brother

1747
02:20:11,545 --> 02:20:13,433
Then you are Anjulica

1748
02:20:13,626 --> 02:20:18,471
Your name will forever be erased from the pages of history

1749
02:20:20,118 --> 02:20:23,976
I will give both of you the punishment of exile from the country

1750
02:20:51,597 --> 02:20:56,219
<i><font color="

1751
02:20:56,244 --> 02:21:00,918
<i>There was one house..</i>

1752
02:21:00,943 --> 02:21:09,063
<i>The house I thought was heaven turned into hell..</i>

1753
02:21:09,088 --> 02:21:13,496
<i>This body of mine was incomplete..</i>

1754
02:21:13,521 --> 02:21:17,460
<i>There was one house..</i>

1755
02:21:17,485 --> 02:21:24,834
<i>The house I thought was heaven turned into hell..</i>

1756

<i><font color="

1757

<i>No one is left alive.. Everyone is erased..</i>

1758
02:21:33,233 --> 02:21:37,476
<i>This body is finished.. This soul is not dead..</i>

1759
02:21:37,501 --> 02:21:41,297
<i>This soul is not afraid of any kind of tormentor..</i>

1760
02:22:06,683 --> 02:22:08,906
This is Bhairav ​​Kavach

1761
02:22:08,931 --> 02:22:11,923
I knock at the door of Rajakumari Manjulika's room

1762
02:22:11,948 --> 02:22:14,244
Show people

1763
02:22:14,406 --> 02:22:17,176
Manjulika's soul is trapped there

1764
02:22:17,719 --> 02:22:21,750
No one wants to know that the soul is not really Manjulika's

1765
02:22:22,207 --> 02:22:24,487
That of Rajakumara Devendranath

1766
02:22:24,512 --> 02:22:26,267
And he is imprisoned here

1767
02:22:29,674 --> 02:22:32,253
I was stuck in that door for years

1768
02:22:32,278 --> 02:22:35,528
A fire burned to take revenge on both of you

1769
02:22:37,175 --> 02:22:39,834
When I came out, you two were in front of me

1770
02:22:40,704 --> 02:22:43,418
I wanted to kill both of you the first night

1771
02:22:44,152 --> 02:22:45,350
kill it

1772
02:22:55,061 --> 02:22:56,521
Then I thought

1773
02:22:56,982 --> 02:22:59,713
It is an easy and quick death for you

1774
02:23:00,915 --> 02:23:02,732
That you also want to be killed that way

1775
02:23:03,877 --> 02:23:05,599
Like it killed me

1776
02:23:07,224 --> 02:23:09,231
Burned alive

1777
02:23:10,093 --> 02:23:13,411
You two played with me last time

1778
02:23:13,524 --> 02:23:15,294
This time it's me

1779
02:23:24,973 --> 02:23:28,227
Little by little I gained everyone's trust

1780
02:23:28,731 --> 02:23:30,398
It's you two

1781
02:23:30,899 --> 02:23:32,479
called Manjulika

1782
02:23:42,761 --> 02:23:44,983
I said that I will not go to the mansion

1783
02:23:46,377 --> 02:23:49,275
I am Manjulika

1784
02:23:49,300 --> 02:23:51,910
I am Manjulika

1785
02:23:51,935 --> 02:23:54,700
Today before Durghashtmi day everyone..

1786
02:23:55,115 --> 02:23:57,076
You are on fire

1787
02:23:57,833 --> 02:23:58,920
then you

1788
02:24:00,296 --> 02:24:01,502
It can't be

1789
02:24:05,341 --> 02:24:06,980
No problem

1790
02:24:07,424 --> 02:24:09,303
Everyone will burn to death

1791
02:24:09,924 --> 02:24:12,305
Everyone burns alive

1792
02:25:11,261 --> 02:25:12,594
Rajapurohita

1793
02:25:13,476 --> 02:25:14,905
What is this?

1794
02:25:15,748 --> 02:25:17,804
Now how to save the royal family?

1795
02:25:18,925 --> 02:25:20,195
Think this first

1796
02:25:20,386 --> 02:25:21,822
How do you survive?

1797
02:25:22,548 --> 02:25:23,445
Look below

1798
02:25:23,986 --> 02:25:25,423
Where are you standing at this time?

1799
02:25:56,991 --> 02:26:01,483
Said to go.. going.. going far away

1800
02:26:01,508 --> 02:26:03,067
Said to go

1801
02:26:10,624 --> 02:26:11,775
Burn him

1802
02:26:13,450 --> 02:26:15,014
Rebirth is not Ruhan's

1803
02:26:15,747 --> 02:26:16,842
It happened to both of you

1804
02:26:19,388 --> 02:26:23,372
Cook and grind
- Run away

1805
02:26:24,677 --> 02:26:26,900
Said to go far.

1806
02:26:29,176 --> 02:26:31,263
Run away

1807
02:26:34,125 --> 02:26:35,498
Said to go

1808
02:26:40,958 --> 02:26:42,823
I trust you both, sister

1809
02:26:49,340 --> 02:26:51,816
Who else understands me like sisters?

1810
02:26:56,887 --> 02:26:59,427
I love you both so much

1811
02:27:23,161 --> 02:27:27,123
Our rebirth is not to repeat our mistakes

1812
02:27:27,331 --> 02:27:29,323
It has to be fixed

1813
02:27:32,600 --> 02:27:34,528
If you are burned, we are also about you (jealousy).

1814
02:27:36,281 --> 02:27:38,334
But because of our soul..

1815
02:27:38,527 --> 02:27:41,654
Everyone burned you brutally

1816
02:27:43,532 --> 02:27:45,698
You were always stuck..

1817
02:27:47,321 --> 02:27:49,511
While living in a human body

1818
02:27:50,355 --> 02:27:51,784
Then after death

1819
02:27:52,272 --> 02:27:54,065
Behind that door

1820
02:27:54,702 --> 02:27:56,655
We couldn't understand you

1821
02:27:57,085 --> 02:27:58,704
We are sorry brother

1822
02:28:01,290 --> 02:28:02,837
Sorry Deboo

1823
02:28:04,698 --> 02:28:08,404
If your revenge is complete by punishing us..

1824
02:28:08,565 --> 02:28:10,549
Then kill us.. burn us

1825
02:28:11,387 --> 02:28:14,316
But let them go

1826
02:28:14,809 --> 02:28:16,373
There is nothing wrong with them

1827
02:29:30,733 --> 02:29:31,797
What's going on?

1828
02:29:33,376 --> 02:29:34,543
He gets immunity

1829
02:29:40,521 --> 02:29:42,306
My ancestors were right

1830
02:29:43,254 --> 02:29:47,008
<i>Someone from the royal family will be reborn to finish him off</i>

1831
02:29:50,397 --> 02:29:53,310
<i>And I couldn't understand.. that end</i>

1832
02:29:53,860 --> 02:29:56,273
<font color="

1833
02:29:57,030 --> 02:29:59,117
<i>that you will understand</i>

1834
02:30:12,896 --> 02:30:43,022

<b><i>..100th subtitle..</i></b>

1836
02:31:11,443 --> 02:31:13,896
I have seen this palace since childhood

1837
02:31:14,517 --> 02:31:15,716
I knew

1838
02:31:16,186 --> 02:31:17,670
With this place for me..

1839
02:31:17,695 --> 02:31:19,417
There must be some connection

1840
02:31:19,935 --> 02:31:23,396
So I started restoring old palaces

1841
02:31:23,874 --> 02:31:25,028
I thought.. who knows

1842
02:31:25,291 --> 02:31:27,521
If you ever get to know anything about this palace

1843
02:31:28,484 --> 02:31:29,936
But when there is an opportunity

1844
02:31:30,153 --> 02:31:32,907
The company handed over my place to Kaushik ji

1845
02:31:32,932 --> 02:31:35,664
So.. that's why you are Kaushik ji

1846
02:31:36,429 --> 02:31:38,763
Why am I killing him?

1847
02:31:39,074 --> 02:31:41,463
But you said he went on a long vacation

1848
02:31:41,497 --> 02:31:44,164
He went on a really long vacation.. Goa

1849
02:31:44,825 --> 02:31:45,912
oh

1850
02:31:45,937 --> 02:31:48,329
I also came here for another job

1851
02:31:49,068 --> 02:31:49,933
But when you come here

1852
02:31:50,324 --> 02:31:52,118
I also felt something

1853
02:31:52,525 --> 02:31:54,794
That means you didn't come to take this palace, Mr. Mandira?

1854
02:31:55,758 --> 02:31:58,050
My name is not even Mandira

1855
02:31:58,074 --> 02:31:58,778
then?

1856
02:32:00,199 --> 02:32:01,667
ACP Rathore

1857
02:32:02,378 --> 02:32:04,433
ACP Rathore?
- Yes

1858
02:32:06,062 --> 02:32:07,610
ACP Rathore?

1859
02:32:08,812 --> 02:32:10,090
Madhuri

1860
02:32:13,268 --> 02:35:41,735
